## Objectives
1. Understand the Database System Environment
2. Explain Different DBMS Functions
3. Understand how to manage Database System

## Database
>- [[2nd Year/(DCIT 24) Information Management/Introduction#Data|Data]] - Collection of Facts
>- Base - Storage Device
- Shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of:
	- End-user data - Raw facts of interest to end user
	- Metadata: Data about data, which the end-user data are integrated and Managed
		- Describe data Characteristics and relationships
### Metadata
Data about the data. The description and context of the data.
Helps to organize, find and understand data.

#### Typical Metadata
1. Title and description
2. Tags and categories
3. Who created and when
4. Who last modified and when
5. Who can access or update

### Types of Databases
1.  **Single-user database** - Supports one user at a time 
	   - only one unit can use it.
	   - **Desktop database**: Runs on PC
2.  **Multiuser database** - Supports multiple users at the same time.
	- **Workgroup databases** - Supports a small number of users or a specific department
	- **Enterprise database** - Supports many users across many departments
3. **Centralized database** - data is located at a single site. All in one database
4. **Distributed database** - Data is distributed across different sites useful for having different branches when having a business
5.  **Cloud database** - Created and maintained using cloud data services that provide defined performance measures for the database. 
   online database, having your database open 24/7. 
6.  **General-purpose database** - Contains a wide variety of data used in multiple disciplines
	   - many disciplines use it.
7.  **Discipline-specific database** - Contains data focused on specific subject areas.
	   - like the use of medical hospital only for one database.
8.  **Online analytical processing (OLAP)** - Enable retrieving, processing, and modeling data from the data warehouse. 
	   - big companies use it having a data warehouse
9.  **Business intelligence** - Captures and processes business data to generate information that support decision making. 
	   - uses artificial intelligence for decision making.

### Database Management System (DBMS)
It is a database software application where you stores the data in such a way that it becomes easier to retrieve, manipulate, and produce information.

#### Example of DBMS Software Application:
1. MS Access
2. MySQL
3. MS Excel
4. Oracle
5. SQLITE and many more

### Architecture
1.  **Database (data) tier** – The database resides along with its query processing languages. We also have the relations that define the data and their constraints at this level.
	   - resides along the getting the data from the environment. Collect all the data needed.
2.  **Application (Middle) Tier** - The application server and the programs that access the database. 
	   - using the system to access the database
3.  **User (presentation) tier** - End-user operate on this tier and they know nothing about any existence of the database beyond this layer. At this layer, multiple views of the database can be provided by the application. All views are generated by applications that reside in the application tier. 
	   - end-user operates this part where the implementation of the system and database happens without them knowing it.

### Database System Environment

### Roles of DBMS
- Intermediary between the user and the database
- Enables data to be shared
- Presents the end user with an integrated view of the data
- Receives and translates application requests into operations required to fulfill the requests.
- Hides database's internal complexity from the application programs and users.

### The DBMS Manages the Interaction between the End user and the Database

### Contrasting Database and File Systems

### DBMS Functions
1.  **Data Dictionary management**
	   - Data dictionary - Stores definitions of the data elements and their relationships.
2.  **Data Storage Management**
    -   Performance tuning: ensuring efficient performance of read and capacity of storage
3.  **Data transformation and presentation**
    - Transforms entered data to conform to required data structures  
    - From data to presentation
4.  **Security Management**
    - Enforces user security and data privacy 
    - It is a must to be implemented for preventing revealing any information without the owner's consent
5.  **Multiuser access control**
    -  Sophisticated algorithms ensure that multiple users can access the database concurrently without compromising its integrity. 
    - many user access.
6.  **Backup and recovery management**
    - Enables recovery of the database after a failure 
    - Recovery of database
7.  **Data integrity management**
	   - Minimizes redundancy and maximizes consistency
8.  **Database access languages and application programming interfaces.**
	- **Query language** - Lets the user specify what must be done without having to specify how.
	- **Structured Query Language (SQL)** - De facto query language and data
9. **Database communication interface** - Accept end-user requests via multiple, different network environments.

## Basic File Terminology
1. Field - could be **Attribute** or **Field Name**  
2. Record - **Tuple**, the value of the field or attribute  
3. File - the whole system.

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|**Data**| Raw facts such as telephone numbers, date of birth, and customer name. Data have little meaning unless they have been organized in some logical manner.|
|**Field**| A character of group of characters (alphabetic or numeric) that has a specific meaning. A field is used to define and store data.|
|**Record**| A logically connected set of one or more fields that describes a person, place of thing. For example the fields that constitute a record for a customer might consists of the customer name, address, phone number and date of birth etc.,|
|**File**| A collection of related records, for example, a file might contain data about the students currently enrolled in CvSU-Imus Campus|
