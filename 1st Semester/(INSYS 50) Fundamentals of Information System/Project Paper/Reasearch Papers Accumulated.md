## Sample Papers
> Needed to write their year it was published and more info about it, I guess.

### [[Computerized Inventory System with EQQ Using Barcode Technology in Property of CvSU-Imus Campus]]
> Uses SDLC (System Development Life Cycle)

#### Methodology
This paper uses different data flow diagram to describe most of the program's processes. It also shows the flow of hardware from the barcode scanner, to the computer, and lastly the printer.

The project development side uses a **V-model** which is a software development process combining elements of both design and prototyping-in-stages, combining the top-down and bottom-up concepts. This is a SDLC concept as well.

Along with that is also having a testing phase with alpha and beta testing present in the project.

### [[Computerized Sales Transaction System and Inventory System for Heritage Aluminum Sales Corporation]]
> By David J. Marquez, Richard B. Ramirez, and Roland Jeremy T. Sasis


### [[Inventory Triggering System with Parcel Status Information for BC-MAN Enterprises]]
> By Daryl G. Cruz, and Jaeziel L. Salazar

The creation of the system utilizes C# as their programming language of choice and Visual Studio being their IDE.

This somewhat different to other conceptual framework but that differences are very little indeed

#### Evaluation


#### Methodology
The inventory system with notification for BC-Man Enterprises was developed using different diagrams and methodologies to specify and clarify the project. This uses a Feature Driven Development methodology in developing the software. It also uses Google Chrome apparently to run the system which needed to support Visual Studio 2012, WAMP Server, MySQL, and any operating system.

##### Research design
it uses FDD or **Feature Driven Development** approach by Puri, 2010. Having an overall model of: developing overall model; build feature list; plan by feature; design by feature; and build by feature.


#### Sources of Data and Tool
This also uses interview to gather information from the clients.

This research uses Stratified Random Sampling targeting one 1 admin, 2 sales coordinator, and 33 client of BC-Man enterprise.

### [[Inventory Management With Cost-Volume Profit (CVP) Analysis and Decision Support System for Liwayway Marketing Corporation]]
> By John Paul T. Argama, Clavel F. Dayuta, and Mariline D. Mendoza

### Methodology

This paper also used different diagram such as a fishbone diagram to specify the real problem solved by the study and to determine the problems as well.

Feature Driven Development approached was utilized in this study having the following methods:
- Develop an overall model
- Build a feature list
- Plan by feature
- Design by feature
- Build by feature

It is mostly utilized to enable them to respond to feedbacks and change or to build exactly and only what is needed. Giving feeling of control to the project.

#### Instrument
It uses a descriptive-observational method of design to focused on the prevailing condition and current practiced at the time of this project research. 




### [[Sales and Inventory Management System for Colegio De Porta Vaga]]
> By Zandra D. Ling, Ian Mary Joy Plasquita, and Elson Torrianna JR.

They uses C# to have a sales and inventory management system for a school named "Colegio De Porta Vaga"

In their conceptual framework they used the following:
#### Input
- Knowledge requirements
	- Transaction processing
	- Database Concept
	- Programming Language
- Software Requirements
	- Visual Basic 2012
	- Operating System (win10)
	- WAMP Server
	- MySQL
	- PDF File
- Minimum Hardware Requriements
	- System unit 1.60 GHz processor
	- Motherboard at least 80 GB of HDD and 512 Mb of RAM
#### Process
- Develop Overall Model
	- Determine scope through interview and consultation
	- Create Overall Model
- Build Feature List
	- Identify a list of features
	- Break large processes into smaller processes
- Plan by Feature
	- Produce development plan
	- Assign features to programmers
- Design by Feature
	- Develop design packages for each feature as classes and methods 
	- Schedule design inspection
	- Diagrams
#### Output
- Sales and Inventory for Colegio De porta Vaga
#### Evaluation

#### Methodology
The methodology used here is mostly a  "Spiral Model" by Gurendo, 2015. The gathering of information method was interview from the admins. While giving some questions to the admins determine there system using the additional information.


##### Research Design
It uses the Spiral model which is a frameworks improvement lifecycle (SDLC). They utilized it to give a well-ordered procedure enabling originator to design and make frameworks that items sill be successful and procedures that can be as proficient as it can be. Having the planning from the start to be accommodated by it including contraints and risks.
- Determine goal
- Evaluate Risk analysis
- Develop and test
- Plan next iteration

#### Sources of data
- uses surveys as primary sources fomr the administration
- secondary sources are formed as backup information to the proponetnts
