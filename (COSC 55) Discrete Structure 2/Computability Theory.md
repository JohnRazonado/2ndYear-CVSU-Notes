- The discussion will focus on the concepts of Computability Theory along with Automata Theory as basic foundations of the course – Discrete Structure.
- Computability theory is the area of mathematics dealing with the concept of an effective procedure—a procedure that can be carried out by following specific rules. 
- For example, one might ask whether there is some effective procedure—some algorithm—that, given a sentence about the positive integers, will decide whether that sentence is true or false. In other words, is the set of true sentences about the positive integers decidable? 
- Or for a much simpler example, the set of prime numbers is certainly a decidable set. That is, there are mechanical procedures, that are taught in the schools, for deciding of any given positive integer whether or not it is a prime number.
- While most of the fundamental research problems have been dealt with, computability theory remains an active field of research and is commonly used to discover the computational expressiveness of new ideas in computer science, mathematics, and physics.

## Turing Machine
- a mathematical model of a hypothetical computing machine which can use a predefined set of rules to determine a result from a set of input variables. 
- Hypothetical machine thought of by the mathematician Alan Turing in 1936. Despite its simplicity, the machine can simulate ANY computer algorithm, no matter how complicated it is!
