# About Notes
This notes are all focused on skimming and reitirating different subjects but some of it is super concise enough even at the powerpoint slide.

## Needed
Download Obsidian md to use this one.

This is a graph view you can use the shortcut `Ctrl + G` to have it show. It will give you some heads up how the notes are connected to each other and so on.

#### Navigate into notes
