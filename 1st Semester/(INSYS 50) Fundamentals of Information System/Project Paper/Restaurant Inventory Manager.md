## Manifesto
Restaurant name: Balai Amadeo
**Titile**: Computerize Inventory Management System with Decision Support System for Balai Amadeo Restaurant

Organizational Background:
- Private organization
- Started from a family business, yung tatay and mga tito and tita ko ay nag-work sa restaurant as managers ng kanilang nanay, which is yung lola ko. 
- Recipes originated from Magdaragat (2002), and when the restaurant closed due to the property owner seeing the business thrive, he wanted to build his own restaurant there. My father created his own Restaurant in 2008 called The Site and hired his mother as a chef to teach the recipes. 
- From Magdaragat, it has a Dampa style of food service, people would buy from the stalls outside and would cook it in the restaurant. In The Site, the seafood recipes remained but it has a menu style of food service.
- Balai Amadeo is located at amadeo and one of the main pathways towards Tagaytay, it serves the well known local produce of Coffee Amadeo. It serves seafood cuisine and also classic Filipino food. 

Mission and Vision guide 
- My father started a business there because he envisions that as the community grow, the word about the restaurant would spread .
As a restaurant that you can pass by when going to a tourist destination of Tagaytay, locals and tourist passerby are the target market of this restaurant.

- to reduce the lost of inventory and management
- 

## What can the system do

	- Check inventory needed by having the ingredients known to the system
		- Having a [[Chapter 5 - Electronic and Mobile Commerce and Enterprise Systems#^4622d7|catalog management]]
	- Process needed items to filled up to the manufacturers and suppliers

- Store all information to database
	- add items on the system

		- normal employee (read ingredients menu only and inventory)
			- Can also have an alert system to let the inventory admin know some shortage.
- Have a decision support system
	- Allowing to have an aid on how to increase profit and what to really put on the menu in the long term
	- This will help enabling the admin become a better problem solver and decision maker
	- Adding tools that presents information about sales, profit, and different chart enabling the support system side helpful to higher ups.
	- This is optional since I don't really know what it really is and how it is implemented on the internal side or things.


## What do it really needs to accomplish?
- Cost-volume profit evaluation (needed since it can handle the sales of the cashier part)
- Decision support system
	- for charts and sales reports
	- more input to the menu system.
