A field of social sciences that focuses on the study of man. This does not pertain only to one aspect of man (i.e. his mind or his environment) but rather on the totality of what it means to be human.

This field looks into man’s physical/biological characteristics, his social relationships and the influences of his culture from the dawn of civilization up to the present.

**“What man is now, is a product of his past”**

Everything in anthropology is interconnected and a complete understanding is necessary to achieve the goal of man understanding himself better.

Four subfields of anthropology:
1. Archaeology  
2. Linguistics
3. Biological Anthropology
4. Cultural Anthropology

… which suggest that human beings are similar and very different at the same time.

## Archaeology
Archaeologists’ focus is the past and how it may have contributed to the present ways of how people conduct their daily lives. As a result, what archaeologists have so far discovered are the unique ways in which human beings adapted to changes in their environment in order for them to survive.

Man’s big brains have allowed them to think and look for ways to prolong their existence. Their thoughts enabled their hands to fashion tools and weapons from the objects they find in their environment. The tools and weapons that proved effective are used repeatedly and when further improved made their life easier.

In this aspect, human beings are similar. The manner, however, that they choose to survive differs. Some men would use power and strength, declare wars, conquer and even try to annihilate races, while others would offer their services, knowledge, resources and even their lives just to ensure that a few deserving human beings would survive. Indeed, people are so similar and yet so different.

## Biological Anthropology
Focus primarily on how the human body adapts to the different earth environments. They look at the probable causes of disease, physical mutation and death. They also want to know how human beings might have evolved from their early forms.

Biological Anthropologists also do comparative studies on human beings both dead and living and other primates (apes and monkeys).


### Biological characteristics human beings share may earn for them complete dominion over all earth creatures and at the same time be the cause of their extinction.

Ex.   A cure during a pandemic (a cure effective for one may have similar effects on others). The virus, Anthrax ( which is lethal for one will be as lethal for many)

## Linguistic Anthropology
**Human survival is primarily linked to their ability to communicate**. This is another capability that resulted from big human brains. The brain comes equipped with specialized areas specifically for the purpose of communication. In addition, an essential part of human communication is language.

Language identifies  a group of people. The words, sounds, symbols, writings and signs that are used are reflections of a group’s culture.
> How people communicate. Thumbs up is a like or "ok"

## Cultural Anthropology
Culture is described as a group of people’s way of life. It includes their behaviours, beliefs, values and symbols that they accept that are socially transmitted through communication and imitation from generation to generation.
> Culture won't match on ethics. There's no right or wrong in the culture.

**Cultural anthropologists** are interested in knowing what makes one group’s manner of living particular to that group and forms an essential part of the member’s personal and social identity. Whether the individual admits it or not, he is a product of his culture.


The contention that culture has a strong impact on how the individual views himself is known as the **Theory of Cultural Determinism** –  Human *nature is determined by the ideas, meanings, beliefs and values* learned as members of a society.
> Ginagaya ang mga gawi ng mga ninuno upang maadapt sa kasalukyang kaayusan.

This is tantamount to saying that who or what a person is maybe determined by the kind of culture he is born into and grew up in. With the different cultures that exist not only in a society but all over the world, anthropologists suggest that there is no universal or right way of being human. The right way is always based on one’s culture. Since, culture vary, there is no one way of understanding human nature.

This theory has positive and negative implications.

(+) suggests that human beings can be shaped/formed to have the kind of life they prefer. It further means that there is no limit placed on the human ability to be or to do whatever they set their minds and hearts into.

( – ) it may mean that people have no control over what they learn. They blindly accept the learning their cultures expose them to. Human beings are seen as helpless and do only what their culture instructs them to do. This places human nature under the mercy of his culture

Cultural diversities are manifested in different ways and at different levels of depth. Symbols are considered the most superficial level of culture and values belong to the deepest level or are considered the core of culture.

Following culture may manifest onto people:
1. Symbols
	- Are the words, gestures, pictures or objects that have a recognized/accepted meaning in a particular culture. Symbols can be shared or copied by other cultures who find them also fitting for their own culture.
	  
	  Ex.   Rings signify commitment
	  Colours have meanings that are similar in many cultures
2. Rituals
   - Are activities participated in by a group of people for the fulfilment of desired objectives and are considered to be socially essential.
   - Ex. **Religious ceremonies** (Need to be formal) like baptisms and weddings, **Social ceremonies**(Somehow have some free will) like birthdays and graduations
3. Heroes
	- Are the **persons from the past or present who have characteristics that are important in a culture**. They may be real or fictitious and are models for behaviour.
	- Ex. Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, Spiderman, Darna
4. Values
	- Are considered to be the **core of every culture**. Values are unconscious and can neither be discussed nor be directly observed but can only be **inferred from the way people act and react to circumstances and situation**.
	- Ex. Respect for elders, Hospitality, Nationalism
