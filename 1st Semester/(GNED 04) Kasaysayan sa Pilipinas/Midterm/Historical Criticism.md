Many documents have primary and secondary segments. For instance, examining a newspaper as a historical source entails a discerning mind to identify its primary and secondary components.

A news item <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">written by a witness of an event</mark> is considered as a **primary source**, while a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">feature articles</mark> is usually considered as a **secondary material**.
