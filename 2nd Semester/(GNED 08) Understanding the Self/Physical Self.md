### Theory of Self
#### Categories of Person's Mental Picture of Self
- I (Known)
	- Knows who they are and what they have done in their life.
- Me (Knower)
	- A separate object or individual a person refers to when describing their personal experiences.
	- Categories
		- Material Self

- 3 periods of Adolescence (according to healthychildren.org)
	- EARLY ADOLESCENCE (11 to 14 years old)
	- MIDDLE ADOLESCENCE (15 to 17 years old)
	- LATE ADOLESCENCE (18 to 21 years old)

## Puberty: A period of Rapid Physical Changes
- Puberty is not the same as adolescence because puberty ends prior to the end of adolescence period (Santrock, 2016).
- MENARCHE – the first menstrual flow for girls
- SPERMARCHE or SEMENARCHE – first ejaculation or nocturnal emission (wet dreams).
- Santrock further explained that puberty is a brain-neuroendocrine process occurring primarily in early adolescence that triggers the rapid physical changes that occur in the adolescent stage of human development.

### Classification of Rapid Changes
1. Primary Sexual Changes
2. Secondary Sexual Changes

### Body Image
- **Santrock** stated that one psychological aspect of physical change in puberty is that “adolescents became preoccupied with their bodies and develop images of what their bodies are liked.”
- refers to the way one sees himself/herself or the way he/she imagines how he/she looks.
- Adolescent with poor body images have negative thought and feelings about their appearance which can either be true or not.
- Young adolescents usually experience an imaginary audience which refers to an egocentric state where the individual imagines and believes that many people are actively listening to or watching him or her.
- In social psychology, this phenomenon is called SPOTLIGHT EFFECT which refers to the belief that others are paying more attention to the person’s appearance and behavior than they really are.

## Factors Affect Perception of Physical Self
### Personal Factors
- **Introspection and Self Reflection**
	- According to Hewstone, introspection is the process by which one observes and examines one’s internal state (mental and emotional) after behaving in a certain way.
	- Studies, however, show that introspection is limited because people are commonly motivated to keep unwanted thoughts and experiences out of memory and consciousness.
- **Self Perception Theory**
	- Bern in 1972 self-perception theory explains that since one’s internal state is difficult to interpret, people can infer their inner states by observing their own behavior – as if they are an outside observer.
- **Self Concept**
	- According to Hewstone, self concept is a cognitive representation of a self-knowledge which includes sum total of all beliefs that people have about themselves.
	- It is a collection of all individual experiences involving one’s characteristics, social roles, values, goals, and fears
- **Personal Identity**
	- Concept a person has about himself develops over the years.
	- Includes aspects of his life that he was born into like family, nationality, gender, physical traits as well as the choices he makes, such as what he does for a living, who his friends are and what he believes in.

### Social Factors
- **Attachment Process and Social Appraisal**
	- According to Bowlby (1969), people can learn about their value and lovability when they experiences how their mothers or caregivers care for them and respond to their needs.
- **Maintaining, Regulating and Expanding the Self in Interpersonal Relationships**
	- Aside from the attachment developed when individuals are still young, the sense of self is continuously shaped through ongoing interaction with others or with significant relationship partners.
- **The Looking-Glass Self Theory**
	- Charles Horton Cooley stated that a person’s self grows out of society’s interpersonal interactions and the perception of others.
	- Therefore, in looking-glass self, other people’s reaction would serve as a mirror in which people see themselves particularly the way in which they perceived and judged by others.
- **Social Comparison**
	- Hewstone et.al cited the work of Leon Festinger in 1954 introduced another way of understanding oneself by comparing one’s traits, abilities, or opinions to that of others.
	- Social Comparison is a process of comparing oneself with others in order to evaluate one’s own abilities and opinions.
	- **Types of Social Comparison**
		- Upward Social Comparison
			- It happens when an individual compares himself to others who are better than him.
		- Downward Social Comparison
			- It happens when an individual compares himself to someone who is in worse situation than he is especially when he is feeling so low.
- **Social Identity Theory (Collective Identity)**
	- Formulated by Tajfel and Turner in 1979 which provides a framework about how people achieve understanding about themselves by being member of their group.
	- People have a need for positive social identity that is why they connect to a wider social network.
	- This idea assumes that as a member of the group they will not be discriminated by an out-group.
	- It will enhance their self-esteem because they feel secured with the shield of group membership
