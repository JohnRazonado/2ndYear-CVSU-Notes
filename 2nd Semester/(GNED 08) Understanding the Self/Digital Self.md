## Selective Self-Presentation and Impression Management
- Self-presentation. The processes individuals use to control the impressions of others social interaction.

### Types of Self-presentation
- **Authentic** – Goal is to create an image consistent with the way we view ourselves
- **Ideal** – Goal is to establish an image consistent with what we wish we were.
- **Tactical self-presentation** – Goal is to establish a public image consistent with what others want or expect us to be.

- Tactical Impression Management. In tactical self-presentation, a person cares only about the impact of the image they present to others, not about whether that image is consistent with their real or ideal self.
	- People who engage in tactical self-presentation usually have an ulterior motive.
	- They often want others to view them positively to get rewards.

- Self-Presentation in Everyday Life
	- Establishing a workable definition of the situation
	- Disclosing information about the self that is consistent with the claimed identity

- Definition of the Situation
	- For social interaction to proceed smoothly, people must achieve a shared definition of the situation
	- They need to agree on who they are, what their goals are, what actions are proper, and what their behaviors mean.


## Needed Extended Self-Due To Sharing
- Self-revelation
	- There’s a sense of being anonymous, or at least one step removed, on electronic media.
	- We post statuses, comments, and ‘tweets’, and it feels very much like talking in an empty room that the likelihood of anyone hearing what we’re saying, or that if they did hear, that they’d pay attention, or that we’d reveal something we didn’t intent to, is slim.
 
- Loss of control
	- Are you addicted to your technology?
	- Are you constantly battling the urge to check your phone, send a text, monitor Twitter, check in on Facebook?
	- Is your whole family dealing with the stress of a constant media stream? Do you panic when you don’t have a reliable wifi?
- How did we get to this technology moment?
	- Children judge and are judged like never before. 
	- Childhood has always been about making mistakes and learning from them. But there isn’t a lot of wiggle room for those mistakes when everything is documented. Everything we do is at risk of being recorded and stored and available online forever.

	- Children judge and are judged like never before. Childhood has always been about making mistakes and learning from them. But there isn’t a lot of wiggle room for those mistakes when everything is documented. Everything we do is at risk of being recorded and stored and available online forever.
	- We talk only within our insular bubbles. What we see, read, follow, and share is all within a confined set of perspectives and opinions with which we already agree. 



## Shared Digital Possessions and Aggregate Self
- Teenagers are quite at each with photos and media becoming digital, online entities rather than physical objects. In fact, virtual objects may be more important to them than some physical artifacts according to a study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.
- The study found that digital objects like e-books, music files, and pictures can have just as much meaning to kids as the real thing, and sometimes more. In the case of pictures, many kids valued their digital collections more because of the comments their friends had attached to the digital objects.


## Shared Sense Of (Cyber) Space
- We speak to others through e-mail, or by talking in a chat room as if we experience a similar presence. But where are we and where are those with whom we speak? If we are not there, and they are not here, where do these conversations take place?
- Turning on our computers, magic appears before us, and with a click of the mouse we enter an environment we have come to call **cyberspace**.
- Behind the screen, we connect with an imaginary somewhere out there. Although it is childlike to think that the people and places are somehow actually behind the screen, in that box, we nonetheless engage the computer screen as a gateway to another place.
- When we speak in chat rooms, interact with others participating in an internet forum, or move into an online virtual community we are simultaneously present in two different spatial environments. In one, we are aware of ’being here’, occupying a physical space in front of a computer screen. Yet, by connecting with others who are not in this environment with us, we are also present in another space that is ‘somewhere out there, beyond the screen’.
- **Cyberspace** is a term inspired apparently by William Gibson’s observation that children playing video games seemed to ‘develop a belief that there’s some kind of actual space behind the screen, someplace you can’t see but you know is there.


## Gender and Sexuality Online
- Media  has defined how females and males should look and act.
- In advertisements, performers, actors and actresses, the standard male should be masculine, dominant, physically fit, has abs, handsome and so on. The standard women are feminine, soft, pretty, thin and so on.
- **Stereotypes**. A stereotype is an oversimplified image or idea of a specific type of person or thing. 
- Objectification occurs when people are viewed as objects existing solely for the pleasure of the viewer, rather than as agents capable of action.
- Self-objectification occurs when people internalize the objectifier’s view of their body and ‘participate in their own objectification’ by seeking to exert a limited power linked to their ability to attract the gaze of others.


### Performing Gender Online
- We all know that social media plays a huge part in our day to day life and the world as we known it. But did you know that according to statistics men and women actually use social media quite differently?
- Interestingly enough, men are more likely to use social media as a way to search for new information and start a new relationships. On the other hand, women tend to use social media as a way of keeping up with and connecting with people they already know.
- The differences don’t stop there. It’s been shown that males and females communicate differently on social media as well. John Hopkins conducted a study where they observed the language of both male and female twitter users. They discovered that women are more likely to use excessive punctuation and exclamatory language. Expressions such as ’omg’ or ‘lol’ are also more associated with women than men.

(Setting boundaries)

## Setting Boundaries To Your Online Self: Smart Sharing
- Good boundaries are important for healthy relationships, but when it comes to our online lives, we are rarely think to create clear-cut borders. Personally, you don’t want to give out private information to the world, and professionally, you don’t want to compromise your credibility and reputation, she said.

### Key advice on devising and defending your boundaries
- **Give yourself permission**. We think we should automatically accept anyone who wants to befriend us on Facebook and others. Give yourself the permission to set boundaries and say no.
- **Consider your purpose**. What helps when setting boundaries is thinking ahead about how you’d like to use social media. Ask yourself: What purpose does social media serve for me? Are you using Facebook to keep in touch with friends, to network professionally or both? Remember that if you’ve got 100 friends on Facebook, many of whom, it’s safe to say are acquaintances, at best all 100 are privy to your personal facts. And that can be risky. So, consider what kinds of information you want out there.
- **Set boundaries surrounding time**. Let’s face it. Sites like Facebook can become a black hole, sucking your time into its abyss if you let them. It’s easy to feel powerless. The internet is like a moving target, and with that comes the expectation that we need to respond to people’s comments right away, return email within a day or even hours and stay plugged in so we’re continuously in the know. But remember that you do have a choice, and there is no requirement. Blocking out 15 minutes a day for catching up on comments and your community can still help you make and maintain connections without feeling stressed and overwhelmed.
- Interacting with others. Interacting online can get tricky. Here are some additional tips specifically for interpersonal communication.
	- Take things slow
	- Ask for clarification
	- Be honest about your feelings
	- Practice the three-strikes-you’re-out rule
	- Give them the benefit of the doubt
	- Honor your feelings and comfort level
	- Be thoughtful in your own responses




## Are You A Good Web Citizen?
- Just like the real-world etiquette we follow like holding the door for the person behind you or covering your mouth when you sneeze the World Wide Web has its own etiquette or **‘netiquette’**.
- From the Image: "Before you post, THINK"
	- ![[Pasted image 20230702123032.png]]
	- **T** - is it True?
	- **H** - is it Helpful?
	- **I** - is it Inspiring?
	- **N** - is it Necessary?
	- **K** - is it Kind?


### Follow These Tips To Be A Good Cyber Citizen
- **Don’t be a cyber-bully**. Treat your cyber friends the way you would want to be treated in real life. Be responsible and treat them with respect. 
- **Think first, act second**. Be careful about what you post to avoid future embarrassment; don’t share anything on websites that you wouldn’t want employers, family members or strangers to see.
- **Protect yourself and those around you**. Stay up to date with privacy settings in social media. If you or someone you know does not want something posted on a website, know that you do have the ability to report objectionable materials.
- **Don’t ‘steal’ information**. Just because information is freely available does not mean that it can be taken away for free or reproduced without proper acknowledgement. If you stumble upon someone else’s information or work that is copyrighted, do not use it for your own benefit. Cite all sources when referencing information that is not yours to avoid plagiarism and legal issues.
- **Share your knowledge**. The way to make a change is to get everyone involved. Share and teach those around you about the importance of being a good cyber citizen.

```
Every time you post something on social media or a picture or a comment or a video, you’re building your digital self. Every post leaves a digital footprint and together those footprints make up your digital self.
