This is mostly how many efficient and proper ways to handle data and accompanied by how to incorporate the algorithm.

Introduction to Algorithms is a book on computer programming by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. The book has been widely used as the textbook for algorithms courses at many universities and is commonly cited as a reference for algorithms.
Each chapter focuses on an algorithm, and discusses its design techniques and areas of application. Instead of using a specific programming language, the algorithms are written in pseudocode. 


### Grokking Algorithms
Bhargava, A. Y. (2016). _Grokking algorithms : an illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people_. Manning Publications Co.

Can be found on Ebook Folder. Focused on introducing the core terms in algorithms by using different child like examples and illustration which is fun to read.

### Algorithm Design Manual
Skiena, S. S. (2021). _Algorithm Design Manual._ Springer Nature.

Can be found on Ebook Folder. This book is more on giving examples that is written in pseudocode before giving all the information but in mathematical way. So a background in intermediate algebra is needed to really understand the symbol used in all of the notations.

This book is focused on giving examples of different terms in C++ way while giving you some initial prerequisite chapters in order to understand what are the notations and symbols used along the way.
