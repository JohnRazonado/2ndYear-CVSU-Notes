**ELLIPSES -** a set of all coplanar points such that the sum of its distances from two fixed points is constant.  
**HYPERBOLA** - a set of all coplanar such that the difference of its distances from two fixed points is constant. 
**DIAMETER -** the longest chord of a circle, connecting any two points of a circle and pass  
through the center.  
**CENTER** - it is the segment connecting any two points of circle.  
**RADIUS** - the constant distance segment connecting the center and any point on the circle.  
**CHORD** - the fixed point equidistant from any point of the circle.
**CONIC** - a set of points whose distances from a fixed point are in constant ratio to their distances from a fixed line that is not passing through the fixed point.
