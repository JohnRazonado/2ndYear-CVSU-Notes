## The Biology of Self 
At birth, the sexual genital (penis for male, vagina for female) is a biological feature that distinguishes males from females. Moreover, during puberty, observable changes in the human body also known as secondary sexual characteristics begin. When physiological changes are  within the adolescent’s reproductive system, he or she is likely to experience sexual urges, become more sensitive to sexual stimuli, and feel sexual arousal. Humans are likely to engage in sexual activities to satisfy sexual urges. However, the kind of sexual activities they engage in may vary. A person should be aware of his/her sexuality and sexual attributes in order to make responsible decisions. Adolescents need to realize the importance of having informed choices.

## Sexual Identity and Gender Orientation
### Biological sex
one’s assignment upon birth and is dependent on physical feature. On the other hand, gender is an identity that is learned and embraced by individual.

### Gender Roles
refer to societal expectations of how men and women should act. Everyone has a basic idea of gender roles:
- men are assumed to be strong and dominant *while women are perceived to be submissive and demure.* 
- Sexual identity and gender orientation underlie one’s concept of self.
- A person expresses his or her sexuality through individuality; one’s belief and behavior lifestyle are based on his or her own perceptions of sexuality.


### Consequences of Sexual Choices
- Sexual intercourse (copulation) is the reproductive act in which the male organ (penis) enters the female’s reproductive tract (vagina). Adolescents couples who engage in sexual intercourse are usually overwhelmed by the sensations they feel during the act. However, if the woman is fertile during the time of intercourse, pregnancy is likely to occur and it lasts approximately nine months before the birth of the child. Having a child entails a big responsibility and should not merely be a consequence of an impulsive moment. Physical risks to having an early pregnancy may impact an adolescent’s development, including miscarriage, emotional stress, and health risks to both mother and infant.
- Aside from pregnancy, another consequence of impulsive and careless sexual intercourse is the risk of acquring sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs). Among common STDs are:
	- Syphilis
	- Gonorrhea
	- Chlamydia
	- Genital Warts
- The most alarming sexually transmitted disease is the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It can be transmitted by contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.
- It is important that everyone *makes responsible* decisions with regard to sexuality and sexual behaviors.
- **Respect for one’s body.** It means taking care of one’s body and avoiding activities that undermine one’s worth and respect.
- **Maturity in thoughts and deeds.** It refers to being objective, rational, and calm, instead of being swept by one’s emotion.
- **Being guided by one’s personal beliefs and core values**. Everyone, especially an adolescent, should always be grounded by his/her personal principles and self-worth.
- **Being future-oriented.** Instead of focusing on the present, a person should always weigh his or her present actions with possible consequences in the future.

## The Sexual Self
The most noticeable change as you start adolescence is physical as a result largely from the secretion of various hormones which affect virtually every aspect of an adolescent’s life.

### Primary Sex
- Characteristics: During puberty sex organs enlarge and mature. Female reproductive organs ovaries, fallopian tube, uterus, clitoris, and vagina Male reproductive organs testes, penis, scrotum, seminal vesicles, and prostate glands.

#### Male Reproductive System Testes
- The two testes(plural of testis) are contained in a bag of skin called the scrotum.
- They have two functions:1. to produce sperm2.to make the hormone testosterone Sperm duct and glands the sperm passes through the sperm ducts, and mixes with fluids produced by glands. 
- The fluids provide the sperm cells with nutrients. This mixture is called semen.
- **Spermache** -  first ejaculation (“wet dreams”)- usually occurs around the age of 13, which indicates that the boy is producing sperm and could fertilize a female egg through sexual activity.

#### Female Reproductive System
- Ovaries the two ovaries contain eggs. Oviducts Each ovary is connected to the uterus by an oviduct fallopian tube. The oviduct is lined with ciliated cells. Every month, an ovum (egg) develops and becomes mature, and is released from an ovary.
- **Uterus and Cervix** - The uterus is a muscular bag with a soft lining. It is where a baby develops until its birth. The cervix is a ring of muscle at the lower end of the uterus. It keeps the baby in place while the woman is pregnant.
- **Vagina and Urethra** - The vagina is a muscular tube that leads from the cervix to the outside of the woman's body. The opening to the vagina has folds of skin called labia that meet to form a vulva. The urethra also opens
- **Menarche** - Women's first menstrual period- uterus starts to build a lining that will later shed through.

### Secondary Sex
- Physiological signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve the sex organs. e.g. the breasts development for females and the broad shoulders of males.
- Characteristics changes occur at puberty because of the following: 
	- Testosterone (produced by the testes) - controls the development of male secondary sexual characteristics 
	- Estrogen (produced by the ovaries) - controls the development of female secondary sexual characteristics.
- **Sexual self-esteem** - influences almost every sexual decision you make, from who you engage with and when to whether you constrain yourself and how.However, very little is known about sexual self-esteem and who has more or less of it.
- Several studies suggest that lower sexual self-esteem negatively impacts sexual satisfaction. Another study, by Hale and Strassberg, reported the results of an experiment to test the effects of low sexual self-esteem and showed that male participants’ sexual arousal was significantly and negatively affected by poor sexual self-esteem.

## What's Sexual Self-Esteem
- Sexual self-esteem is feeling capable of being involved in sexual practices with successful procedures and results. Sexual self-esteem tends to differ with age and one’s partner’s sexual skills or interest, and it may vary for men and women and across cultures. 
- Studies also suggest that sexual self-esteem is negatively affected by  variety of  life experiences including [childhood](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development) [sexual abuse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sexual-abuse), sexual victimization, physical disabilities, and health issues. 
- Another study found that sexual self-esteem is positively associated with general self-esteem. More broadly, many cultures push us to restrict our thoughts about [sexuality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex) and to develop low sexual [confidence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/confidence). Others tie sexual self-esteem to ideals of beauty and [attractiveness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/beauty). In turn, there's always the urge to chase after these ideals. When we don't succeed, we may experience it as a reflection of our lack of desirability and develop low self-worth.

### Who's highest Levels of Sexual Self-Esteem
- Many think that married people have the highest level of sexual self-worth. After all, the one person they are with already knows them very well and they likely don't feel threatened by that person. Competition  is low and ideals of beauty and attractiveness are fading over time. Moreover, many cultures sanction and idolize marriages and it only makes sense that married people would feel better about themselves. However, my new finding suggest that this is not the case when it comes to sexual self-esteem. Research findings indicate that married people have lower levels of sexual self-esteem than almost all groups measured.

- Seven relationship-status groups were included in this study: married individuals, who comprise the largest group of the sample (57.4%); never-married single (14%); never-married individuals who have a partner but they live apart (4.3%), never-married individuals who cohabit with their partner (13.1%); divorced separated single (5.3%), divorced/separated individuals who have a partner but they live apart (2.7%), and divorced separated who currently cohabit with their partner (3.3%). The results are striking.

-  In terms of sexual self-esteem, men who were divorced/separated and living apart from a partner and never-married cohabiting men were comparable to married men, while only never-married cohabiting women showed lower ratings than married women. The detailed and rich data of the Pairfam survey show that even singles who have never been married tend to report higher levels of sexual self-esteem.

### Why Married People Have Lower Level of Self-Esteem
- As in my other post on sexual communication skills , we can only speculate about why married people showed lower levels of sexual self-esteem than most groups. One possibility is that sexual self-esteem levels work in reverse: People with lower sexual self-esteem may be more likely to marry. They might be motivated in part by wanting to feel safer and to cover for their lower sexual self-esteem. 


## Sexual Self Image
- Gila Shipiro  (a psychotherapist and certified sex therapist) defines sexual self-esteem as “the feelings you have about your body and your confidence level in how you relate intimately to someone else.
- It’s what you bring of yourself, both emotionally and physically, to sex and relationships  what you do with that and how you share that with someone else. 
- Sexual self-esteem affects every sexual choice you make.

### Difference of it now
- Typically, people don’t think about how they developed their sense of sexuality, it just happens through your lived experience. 
- Most people don’t realize the importance of the different components that shape your own identity until a major life event happens. This event can impact things such as not being able to go to your favourite restaurant because it is inaccessible, not being able to hug your kids or your partner because of limited arm function, not being able to go back to the same job and feeling like you can’t provide for your family, or even just looking in the mirror and seeing a different body than you are used to seeing.

### What Can be done
- Finding things that give you control of your life and give you a sense of accomplishment, purpose, responsibility, and routine can help boost your confidence and motivation. This means finding a reason to get up and get out into the world every day. This can include a hobby, a job, a volunteer role, schooling, an exercise program, social activities, whatever you want.

### What Do I Need to Know?
- The path everyone takes will look different and everyone will build their confidence in their own way. Finding the resources that are available to you in your area and how to access them is an important place to begin.

## My Role
> I still don't know what really is this.

- The process of regaining your sexual self-view, self-confidence, and boosting your self-esteem can seem very overwhelming at the beginning. These feelings are common especially soon after injury. To gain a better understanding of yourself and get back in touch with yourself takes time, a sense of openness, and support from peers, family, friends and health care professionals. But ultimately, no one can do this for you  it’s up to you to start the process.
