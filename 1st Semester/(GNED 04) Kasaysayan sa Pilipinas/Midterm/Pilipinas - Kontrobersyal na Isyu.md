## First Mass: Butuan historiansa ask CBCP to resolve first mass controbersy in city's favor

Historians are hoping that *Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines* (CBCP) would finally declare the place of the first mass in **Mazaua**, a place in *Butuan* now called **Masao**, not Limasawa Island in Leyte.

Before the 491st anniversary mass on Saturday, March 31, Butuan city Heritage president Greg Hontiveros said they're confident their new data and evidences finally completed to find the truth about this issue. This event is very symbolic and important to the church.

Account said on March 31,1521, Easter Sunday, Friar Pedro Valderrama celebrated mass together with Ferdinand Magellan and his men. With the Spaniards wer the ruler of Mazaua Rajah Siaiu and brother Rajah Colambu, ruler of Butuan. Then they planted a cross on the highest hill and stayed for seven days. Then they helped harvest rice together with a hundred of Rajah's men.

According to Father Joesilo Amalla, curator of Butuan Diocesan Liturgical Museum. They're harvesting to two days when they arrived on Good Friday. Which means they went to Mazaua, not Limasawa but somewhere in Mindanao. There was nothing to be harvested on Limasawa and yet they harvested for two days.

The land is a huge agricultural area being a hundred of people help harvest. Also, Limasawa island get their rice harvested from the surrounding island.

Amalla pointed out the Yale Codex, which according to Magellan scholars is more important than Ambrosiana Codex in justifying the past of both claims.

The documents is in the hands of Yale University now while the other two French manuscripts are in Parish, in the French National Library.

He also stated that they included other versions of Antonio Pigafetta, because there are subtle indicators that can be used. Then also he presented a soon-to-be-published book "The Anthology of the First Mass Controversy in the Philippines" which hopes to shed light to CBCP.

#### Pagkakaintindi
Nasabi na hindi sa Limawasa naganap ang unang misa dahil sinabi nila sa kwento sa paglalakbay ni Magellan ay nag-ani sila ng mga palay kung saan hindi ka makakapag-ani sa Limawasa dahil kumukuha ang lugar ng kanilang bigay sa mga karatig-bayan kung saan kasama ang Butuan ayon kay Father Joesilo Amalla.

Isa ring mahalagang rason ay ang Yale Codex at kasama raw dito ang mga bersyon ni Antonia Pigafetta, ang chronicler ng Magellan's voyage.

Pinakita din ni Amalla ang manuskrito ng librong na malapit nang mailambag na pinamagatang " The Anthology of the First Mass Controversy in the Philippines."

## The Rizal Retraction and Other Cases
By **Peter Jaynul V. Uckung**

http://nhcp.gov.ph/the-rizal-retraction-and-other-cases/

The retraction is supposed to be signed by Jose Rizal moments before his death. Most of the witnesses are Jesuits. But the document only surfaces for public viewing on May 13,1935. Found by Fr. Manuel A. Gracia at the Catholic heirarchy's archive in Manila. Only the reproductions are shown in public and not the original one.

Fr. Pio Pi, a Spanish Jesuit reported that as early as 1907, the retraction of Rizal was copied verbatim and published in Spain, and reprinted in Manila. Fr. Gracia, who found the original document also copied it verbatim.

There were conflicting version of the text in both reproductions. Add to this is also the date when Rizal supposedly signed, it was on "**December 29, 1890**" in the original Spanish document.

Another supposedly original document resurfaced, one has the date "December 29,189C" where the "o" was altered to look like a "C" then another has a date of "December 29, 1896" making the "o" became a "6".

For other believed that of the Rizal retraction document is fake, reported Roman Roque as the forger of Rizal's signature, the man who also forge Urbano Lacuna's signature, which was used to capture Aguinaldo. The mastermind being Lazaro Segovia that was approached by Spanish friars during the final day of Filipino-American was to forge Rizal's signature.

Antonio K. Abad revealed the story being the neighbor of Roman Roque.

Making the rectraction issues a **wild fire** in the *forest of the night*.

Others believed that it is purposely invented by the friars to deflect the heroism of Rizal which centered on friar abuses (Noli me and El Fili).

Incidentally, Fr. Pio Pi, who copied verbatim Rizal’s retraction, also figured prominently during the revolution. It was him, Andres Bonifacio reported, who had intimidated to Aguinaldo the cessation of agitation in exchange of pardon.

Few people also believed that the autobiography of Josephine Bracken is also forged badly on February 22, 1897. It is supposedly written by Josephine herself in the fact that they're married under Catholic rites. But there's a glaring differnce between the penmaship of the said document compared to other letters written by her to Rizal.


Whether Rizal did retracted or not, he's still a hero. But if he doesn't, someone needs to pay for trying to deceive a nation.

#### Pagkakaintindi
Ang iba na naniniwala na kagagawan ito ng mga prayle upang malihis ang pagiging bayani ni Rizal na nakatuon sa pang-aabuso ng mga prayle.

Naging malaking problema ito dahil ang mga retraksyon o pagbawi niya sa mga kasulatan niya ay malaking epekto sa kasaysayan ng bansa bagamat maraming nagsasabi na peke ito o at pineke nila lahat ng sulat upang mabago ang tingin ng mamamayan kay Rizal.


## Andress Bonifacio: Old questions and new answers
Professorial Chair Lecture
City College of Manila
November 30, 1997

When the Mayor of Manila, Alfredo S. Lim, and I signed the memorandum of agreement regarding the Distinguished Professorial Chair on Andres Bonifacio and the Katipunan I knew that research on Bonifacio would yield more questions than answers. The challenge, according to Mayor Lim, was not to present more questions, but answers. To give you an example of my problem would mean remembering the round-table discussion sponsored by the Philippine Historical Institute in 1996 which was held in the viper's pit you probably know as UP Diliman. The discussion was initiated in the hope of resolving the long-running controversy of where and when the first Cry of the Revolution occurred. Was it Balintawak or Pugad Lawin? Was it August 23 or 26, 1896?

#### Pagkakaintindi
**Saan ba talaga naganap ang unang sigaw ng Rebolusyon? Balintawak ba o Pugad Lawin? Agosto 23 o 26 ng 1896 ba?**

By the time we adjourned at five in the afternoon, we had more questions indeed, than answers. As an added bonus, we all left the hall with a miserable headache. Instead of just Balintawak and
Pugad Lawin we ended up with: Bahay Toro, Kangkong, Pasong Tamo (not in Makati), Banlat,
Daang Malalim, Pugad ng Lawin, and Pacpac Lawin.

### The only Photograph we have of Bonifacio
- From 1893 to the outbreak of the revolution in August 1896
	- Bonifacio leaved and move place to place
	- 11E Calle de Sagunto (now Santo Cristo), Binondo in1893 before he married Gregoria de Jesus
- One source says that this acsesoria was big enough for Bonifacio to offer hospitality to Ladislaw Diwa, Teodoro Plata, and Aurelio Tolentino when they had nowhere to go. I wouldn't be surprised if the early Katipunan meetings were held there.
- When Bonifacio and Oryang got married in 1894 they spent a week in the Oroquieta house of their ninong, Restituto Javier.
- the newlyweds found a place on Calle Anyahan in front of the visita de San Ignacio.
- When Oryang was with child, the Bonifacios moved to the de Jesus home in 13 Calle Baltazar (now Zamora), Kaloocan. Andres Jr. was born here
- When the child was strong enough to travel outside lolo's house, the Bonifacios moved to a house in Cervantes (now Rizal Avenue) in the district of San Ignacio, Bambang. Santiago Alvarez described the house thus, "tabla ang palarindingan at pawid ang bubong, kainam ang laki, bagamat mababa ang silong.
- ."52 Alvarez adds that Emilio Aguinaldo was initiated as a Katipunero in this house in the evening of March 14, 1896, but Aguinaldo says in his memoirs that he was initiated in a house on Clavel in Binondo.
- source states that two months after the birth of Andres Jr., the Bonifacio's moved to a house in Dulongbayan, Tutuban which according to Oryang, burned down, on Maundy Thursday, 1896 at 3pm
- They moved from house to house until they found refuge at 57 Calle Lavezares, the home of Pio Valenzuela ninong of Andres Jr. who eventually died of measles in this house.
- last Bonifacio residence mentioned in the sources is actually on one long street today that used to be separate streets in 19th century, Trozo -- Calle Magdalena according to Oryang but 73 San Jose according to Valenzuela.55 Carmen Guerrero Nakpil, Chairman of the Manila Historical Commission plans to place markers on these sites to give people in the area a sense of history and give modern Filipinos a link to the past.
- Could we say that Bonifacio was yesterday's Yuppie? What if Bonifacio wanted to evade the authorities who kept watch over his activities? From 1893 to August 1896 Bonifacio lived in about a dozen different places. Whatever his reasons, Bonifacio was an NPA. He had No Permanent Address

1. Bernabe Bonifacio, age 36, tailor, married (probable wife Rafaela Uy Tangco, age 29, cigarrera).

2. Dionicio Bonifacio, age 26 or 36, married carrocero, probable wife Francisca Hilario, age 35 cigarrera. They had a son Telesforo age six. In another vecindario entry the same Dionisio Bonifacio's age is given as 35 his occupation tendero. He is still married to Francisca Hilario age 37 cigarrera but now with two children Telesforo four and Marcela, three.

3. Geronima Bonifacio, 24, cigarrera.

Where on earth was Andres Bonifacio? Did he really come from Tondo? What if he was registered in another suburb of Manila? Maybe he was a temporary resident of Tondo? Temporary residents are not registered in the vecindarios anyway. Maybe the person assigned to collect from Bonifacio was afraid of our hero? Maybe the collector pocketed Bonifacio's tax? Maybe the collector was delinquent, negligent or all of the above? If Bonifacio was indeed a resident of Tondo, why was he not enrolled for the head tax among the naturales in Tondo? The bottom line is -- if Bonifacio did not pay his taxes, he did not have a cedula. If he didn't have a cedula, what did he tear up during the famous Cry of Balintawak or Pugad Lawin?

#### Pagkakaintindi
Nagkaroon sila Bonifacio at Oryang ng anak na nagngangalang Bonifacio Jr.. Sa kasamaang palad ay namatay ito sa tigdas. Maraming nilipatan na mga bahay ang pamilyang Bonifacio dahil simula 1893 hanggang Agosto 1896 ay nakatira siya sa isang dosenang lugar. Kung ano man ang rason ay siya ay walang permanenteng address o NPA.


### Oryang
One of the best result is having a women's perspective in the light of the revolution being Oryang on his writing named "Mga tala ng aking buhay"[The Stars of my life].


#### Pagkakaintindi
Kuha ito sa POV ni Gregoria de Jesus na kilala bilang "Oryang" sa kanyang mga sulat sa "Mga tala ng aking buhay".

![](Pasted%20image%2020221017092113.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020221018120931.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020221017092323.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020221018121236.png)

Bagamat wala silang kahit anong tala na nagpakasal sila sa Binondo ayon sa mga nakalakal sa kamay nina Fr. Moises Andrade, assistant parish prient ng Binondo. Maaring dahil hindi pa talaga napapatawad ng magulang ni Oryang siya mismo. Ang tatay niya ay siguro bagamat ang nanay niya ay hindi.

In the end, due to have no records in Tondo even for the head tax, he was not enrolled to which is a big question if Bonifacio really have a cedula. But when Bonifacio was apprehended on September 29,1896 and brought to a detachment in the Tranvia Station of Malabon. The investigation revealed that his personal cedula 2492892 was fake. This explains everything of how this man could tear cedulas in more than one place.

### How plebian was Bonifacio
Many Filipinos in the same generation as my parents can rattle off the honorific titles we attach to our heroes: Jose Rizal is the "Great Malayan," Emilio Jacinto is the "Brains of the Katipunan," Apolinario Mabini is the "Sublime Paralytic" and Andres Bonifacio is the "Great Plebeian." One wonders why there is no honorific or even "horrorific" title for Emilio Aguinaldo.

We have no problem with "Great Malayan" except during the 1995 International Rizal Conference in Kuala Lumpur when the Malaysians asked themselves, who is this presumptuous Christian Filipino who claims to be the Great Malayan? Filipinos refer to the Malayan race while Malaysians take the term to mean citizens of Malaysia. Mabini was the "Brains of the Revolution" a title once questioned by Gregoria de Jesus who insisted that the title rightfully belonged to Jacinto. I have no problem with "paralytic" but when combined with "sublime" I don't quite know what it means.

Do Filipinos stop and try to unravel what these honorifics really mean? Filipinos can attach these titles to heroes as easily as they pin tails on donkeys at children's parties. However, when pressed to define or explain these honorifics they are tongue-tied.

I traced the confusion over Bonifacio, the plebeian to its origin and ended up with the most widely used source, a biography in Spanish by Epifanio de los Santos published in 1917. De los Santos says Bonifacio was a vendedor of canes and paper fans. Vendedor in Spanish is very close to the English "vendor." No problem with that but then De los Santos also lists Bonifacio's other occupations: mandatorio at the English trading firm Fleming and Company, where he rose to become  corredor of tar and other products. Later, Bonifacio moved to the German firm Fressell and Company where he worked as a bodeguero.

#### Pagkakaintindi
Maraming mga honoraryong titulo tayong nilalagay sa ating mga bayani:
Jose Rizal ang "Great Malayan"
Emilio Jacinto ang "Utak ng Katipunan"
Apolinario Mabini ang "Sublime Paralytic" at
Andres Bonifacio ang "Great Plebian"

Masyadong nakakainsulto ang salitang "Plebian" dahil maaring ang ibig sabihin nito lamang ay "commoner" o "common people" pero ginagamit rin ito upang matawag ang isang tao bilang "ignoble", "uncultured" o "coarse" na kung saan hindi ito ang mga ugali ni Andres Bonifacio.

Maraming deskripsyon na trabaho ang meron si Bonifacio. Mula sa vendedor, mondatoria, bodeguero hanggang sa pagiging portero. Hindi masasabing mahirap siya bagamat maaring may kaya dahil sa panahon noon ay malaki nang mga trabaho ito lalo na kapag ibang bansa ang mga kompanya. Bagamat, hindi parin malinaw kung ano ang mga trabaho nito dahil sa mga translasyon na maraming kahulugan at ang ibang mga historyador ay hindi nagsasang-ayon kung ano nga ba ang tamang pakahulugan nito. Ang maaring tumpak lang ay ang mga binibenta niyang Abanico at Bastones. Maaring sabihin natin na siya ay Yuppies ngayon sa panahon nila noon.

Hindi parin natin alam kung ano talaga ang kinikita ni Bonifacio sa mga trabaho na ito

Sa kabilang banda, makikita naman natin na hindi rin naman mayaman ang asawa ni Bonifacio na si Oryang. Dahil kailangan niyang tumigil kasama ng isa niyang ate para makapag-aral ang kanilang dalawang lalaki. Hindi rin sila mahirap dahil may mga trabahador silang nag-aararo at nagaayos ng lupa nila na si Oryang mismo ang tumitingin at nagsusweldo sa kanila.

### Going back to Andres' social status:
All the sources of the period also state that no masons were poor or uneducated. Bonifacio was a mason. A certain Antonio Salazar y Agustin when interrogated in September 1896, shortly after the outbreak of the revolution, stated, "I knew Andres Bonifacio, I was present at his initiation to the lodge Taliba... had nothing to do with him since except on one occasion when I helped him push some cases of vermouth into the bodega of Simeon Piesol." If Bonifacio was a mason then he was closer to middle class than the lowest class.

Bonifacio was invited to the organizational meeting of La Liga Filipina in 1892. That he was allowed to be in the same room as Jose Rizal and other ilustrados also points to a higher social class than that assigned him by historians and textbook writers. Bonifacio unlike Rizal and the other ilustrados may not have finished college; nor could he boast of postgraduate degrees but he definitely had some education. Agoncillo estimates that Bonifacio's "education could not possibly have gone beyond what is now Grade Four."64 Despite Agoncillo's views on Bonifacio's education I think it is safe to assume that he could read, speak and write enough Spanish to be hired into British and German trading firms in Manila.

#### Pagkakaintindi
Maraming nagsasabi sa panahon na iyon na ang mga nagmamason ay hindi mahihirap o walang pinag-aralan. Nagmamason si Bonifacio. Kung totoo nga ito ay mas malapit siya sa pagiging middle class kaysa sa lowest class.

Imbitado rin si Bonifacio sa pagpupulong ng La Liga Filipina noong 1892. Kasama sila Rizal at ibang kasapi nito na mga nakapag-aral at nakapagtapos ng kolehiyo. Masasabi natin na may pinag-aralan si Bonifacio, hindi nga lang kasing taas ng kay Rizal bagamat maaring nakatapos siya ng Grade 4 kung maiituturing ngayon. Dahil masasabi natin na kaya niyang magbasa, magsulat, at magsalita ng Espanyol upang makapasok sa angkatan ng British at German firms sa Maynila.

Kaya malayo si Bonifacio sa pagiging "Plebian" dahil siya ay mag pinag-aralan, may mga trabaho siyang mobile job at nakapag-asawa siya ng may maayos na pamilya. Kaya maari nating matanong dahil sa sosyo-ekonomic na kaligiran ni Bonifacio kung saan ang Rebolusyon ba ng Pilipinas ng 1896 ay tunay nga bang "Paghihimagsik ng mga masa"?
