- An MIT grad student back in the 1930s
- Notice some analogy between operations of switching devices leading to his master's thesis published in 1938.
- Figured out that current can flow from one terminal to other; when it is open, current can't flow in a switch system. The light bulb for example is on if, and only if, current flows through it. Which happens only if, and only if, the switch is closed
