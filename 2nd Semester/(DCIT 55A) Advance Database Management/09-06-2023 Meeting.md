 `Wala nang project so far pero may mga activities regarding sa connection sa PHP at sa database.

## Join
`JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.


Creating new table called **Books**:


### Inner Join
`INNER JOIN` keyword selects record that have matching values in both tables.

code
```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM table1 
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

other sample code
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomersID;
```



### Left Join
`LEFT JOIN` keyword re

code
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

### Right Join

code
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

### Full Join (probably same as Outer Join)

![[Pasted image 20230610223701.png]]

code
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### Problems
There's no real FULL JOIN on MySQL and MariaDB but here's a solution:

### Exercise
Apply the following join function syntax to the last activity:
Full Join
Inner join
Left Join
Right Join
Self Join (not needed)

NOTE: The sample table doesn't have any similar columns on the table.

#### Inner Join
```SQL
SELECT authors.first_name, authors.last_name, books.title FROM 
	authors INNER JOIN books
    	ON authors.id = books.authors_id;
```

##### Three table Inner Join
```SQL
SELECT authors.first_name AS "author(first name)", authors.last_name AS "author(last name)",  books.title AS 'Book Title', editors.first_name AS "editor(first name)", editors.last_name AS "editor(last name)" FROM 
	authors INNER JOIN books
    	ON authors.id = books.authors_id
	INNER JOIN editors
    	ON editors.id = books.editors_id;
```

#### LEFT JOIN
```SQL
SELECT translators.first_name, translators.last_name, books.title FROM 
	translators LEFT JOIN books
    	ON translators.id = books.translators_id;
```

Editors and books
```SQL
SELECT editors.first_name, editors.last_name, books.title FROM 
	editors LEFT JOIN books
    	ON editors.id = books.editors_id;
```

![[Pasted image 20230620220218.png]]

#### RIGHT JOIN
Translators and books
```SQL
SELECT translators.first_name, translators.last_name, books.title FROM 
	translators RIGHT JOIN books
    	ON translators.id = books.translators_id
    ORDER BY translators.first_name;
```

Editors and books
```SQL
SELECT editors.first_name, editors.last_name, books.title FROM 
	editors RIGHT JOIN books
    	ON editors.id = books.editors_id;
```
![[Pasted image 20230620220754.png]]


Authors and editors
```SQL
SELECT authors.first_name AS 'Author (firstname)', authors.last_name AS 'Author (lastname)', editors.first_name AS 'Editor (firstname)', editors.last_name AS 'Editor (lastname)' FROM 
	authors RIGHT JOIN editors
    ON
    	authors.id = editors.id;
       
```

#### FULL OUTER JOIN
https://gist.github.com/ebta/d3a1c86ca41d885fdefcc75bb440a51b

```SQL
SELECT authors.first_name, authors.last_name, books.title
    FROM authors
    FULL OUTER JOIN books
    ON 
    	authors.id = books.authors_id
	ORDER BY authors.first_name;

```

>This will output error

```SQL
SELECT authors.first_name, authors.last_name, books.title 
	FROM authors
    LEFT JOIN books
    	ON 
        	authors.id = books.authors_id
    
UNION

SELECT authors.first_name, authors.last_name, books.title 
	FROM authors
    RIGHT JOIN books
    	ON 
        	authors.id = books.authors_id;
