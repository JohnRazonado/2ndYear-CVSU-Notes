## Objectives
- Learn what combinatorics is
- Familiarize on the role of Combinatorics in computer science

## Introduction
- also called combinatorial mathematics, the field of mathematics concerned with problems of selection, arrangement, and operation within a finite or discrete system. Included is the closely related area of combinatorial geometry.
- Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures.
- The development of computer technology in the second half of the 20th century is a main cause of the interest in finite mathematics in general and combinatorial theory in particular. Combinatorial problems arise not only in numerical analysis but also in the design of computer systems and in the application of computers to such problems as those of information storage and retrieval.
- Combinatorics has many applications in other areas of mathematics, including graph theory, coding and cryptography, and probability.

## Factorials
- Simpler operation of counting number of *orders*.
- To simplify notation, mathematicians use a “!” called factorial. For example, 5! (“five factorial”) is the same as 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Above we have just shown that there are n! possibilities to order n objects.

## Combinatorics and Probability
- Combinatorics has many applications in probability theory. You often want to find the probability of one particular event and you can use the equation

## Permutation and Combination
### Permutation
- Every detail matters
- Used for list when order matters

### Combination
- Details don't really matters.
- Used for groups that order doesn't matter.
