This is the continuation of Discrete Structure 1. Providing the combinatorics and probability theory required in design and analysis of algorithms, in system analysis, and in other areas of computer science.

Discrete structure is a **set** of discrete elements which certain operations are defined.

Most mathematics of computer science course or alike of it is built mostly by Discrete Math.

## Key Terms

**Discrete** - implies non-continuous and therefore finite and countable set but not uncountable sets such as the real numbers.

**[[Sets and Logic#Logic|Logic]]** - the tool for reasoning about truth and falsity of a statement.

**[[Sets and Logic#Set|Set]]** - In mathematics, it is a well-defined collection of distinct objects. The arrangement of the elements doesn't matter at all.

**[[Structured Query Language|SQL]]** - or Standard Query Language, the standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases.

**[[Sets and Logic#Relation|Relation]]** - a set of two ordered pairs containing one object from each set.

**Cardinality Ratio** - or mapping cardinalities, a concept that describe the binary relationship set and its types. 
> This part is someone unknown and questionable to me to say at least

**[[Sets and Logic#Function|Function]]** - an expression, rule or law that defines the relationship between one variable (independent) to another (dependent).

**Recursion** - a function that calls itself, which gets into a loop of itself.

**[[Overview - Prob Comb Algo#Combinatorics|Combinatorics]]** - Branch of mathematics that studies the enumeration, combination and permutation of sets of elements.

**[[Probability]]** - Likeliness of something is to happen.

**[[Random Variable]]** - Numerical description of the outcome of statistical experiment. Set of possible values from a random experiment.

**[[Automata Theory|Automata]]** - Deals with logic of computation to understand  how machines compute functions, and defined function as computable.
