## Decision Making and Problem Solving
- Strategic planning and the overall goals of the organization 
	- Set the course for decision making, helping employees and business units achieve their objectives and goals

### Decision Making as a Component of Problem Solving

- Decision-making phase
	- **Intelligence stage:** Identify and define potential problems or opportunities 
	- **Design stage:** Develop alternative solutions to the problem 
	- **Choice stage:** Select a course of action
![[Pasted image 20230124151944.png]]
> Figure 8.1: How Decision Making Relates to Problem Solving
> The three stages of decision making- intelligence, design, and choice - are augmented by implementation and monitoring to result in problem solving.

- **Problem solving** 
	- Goes beyond decision making to include the implementation stage
- **Implementation stage** 
	- Solution is put into effect 
- **Monitoring stage** 
	- Decision makers evaluate the implementation

### Programmed Versus Nonprogrammed Decisions
- **Programmed decision**
	- Decision made using a rule, procedure, or quantitative method 
	- Easy to computerize using traditional information systems
- **Nonprogrammed decisions** 
	- Deals with unusual or exceptional situations 
	- Not easily quantifiable

### Optimization, Satisficing, and Heuristic Approaches
- **Optimization model**
	- Finds the best solution, usually the one that will best help the organization meet its goals 
- **Satisficing model** 
	- Find a good—but not necessarily the best—problem solution 
- **Heuristics** 
	- Commonly accepted guidelines or procedures that usually find a good solution

### The Benefits of Information and Decision Support Systems
- Performance of these systems is: 
	- Typically a function of decision quality and problem complexity 
- Decision quality can result in: 
	- Increased effectiveness 
	- Increased efficiency 
	- Higher productivity

> Figure 6.14 - Decision-Making Level
> Strategic managers are involved with long-term decisions, which are often made infrequently. Operational managers are involved with decisions that are made more frequently.


### A Comparision of DSS and MIS
- DSS differs from an MIS in: 
	- The type of problems solved 
	- The support given to users 
	- The decision emphasis and approach 
	- The type, speed, output, and development of the system used

### Components of a Decision Support System
- Database and a model base 
	- Core of a DSS 
- Dialogue manager 
	- Allows decision makers to easily access and manipulate the DSS
![[Pasted image 20230124225648.png]]
> Figure 6.15 - Conceptual Model of a DSS
> DSS components include a model base; database; external database access; access to the Internet and corporate intranet, networks, and other computer systems; and a user interface or dialogue manager.

### The Database 
- Data-driven DSS 
	- Performs qualitative analysis based on the company’s databases 
	 - Taps into vast stores of information contained in the corporate database, retrieving information on inventory, sales, personnel, production, finance, accounting, and other areas 
	 - Often uses data mining and business intelligence.

### The Model Base
- Model base 
	- Allows managers and decision makers to perform quantitative analysis on both internal and external data 
- Model management software 
	- Can coordinate the use of models in a DSS
|Model Type | Description| Software|
|---|---|---|
|Financial| Provides cash flow, internal rate of return, and other investment analysis| Spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel|
|Statistical| Provides summary statistics, trend projections, hypothesis testing, and more| Statistical programs, such as SPSS or SAS|
|Graphical| Assists decision makers in designing, developing, and using graphic displays of data and information| Graphics programs, such as Microsoft PowerPoint|
|Project Management| Handles and coordinates large projects; also used to identify critical activities and tasks that could delay or jeopardize an entire project if they are not completed in a timely and cost-effective fashion| Project management software, such as Microsoft Project|

### The User Interface or Dialogue Manager
- Allows users to interact with the DSS to obtain information 
- Assists with all aspects of communications between the user and the hardware and software that constitute the DSS

## Group Support Systems
- Consists of most elements in a DSS, plus software to provide effective support in group decision making 
- Also called *group decision support system* or *computerized collaborative work system*

![[Pasted image 20230124230753.png]]

	- Complex systems will seldom be used by groups 
- Flexibility 
	- Takes different decision-making styles and preferences into account 
- Decision-making support for different approaches 
	- Delphi, brainstorming, group consensus, nominal group technique
- Anonymous input 
	- Helpful in ranking performance of managers 
- Reduction of negative group behavior 
	- Avoids dominance of one member
- Unified communication 
	- Integrates different communication systems 
- Automated record keeping 
	- Detailed records of meetings are automatically generated

### GSS Software
- Helps with joint work group scheduling, communication, and management
- Software from Autodesk 
	- Has GSS capabilities that allow groups to work together on design

### GSS Alternatives

- Local area decision network 
- Teleconferencing 
- Wide area decision network

![[Pasted image 20230124233746.png]]
> Figure 6.18 - The GSS Decision Room
>  For group members who are in the same location, the decision room is an optimal GSS alternative. This approach can use both face-to-face and computer-mediated communication. By using networked computers and computer devices, such as project screens and printers, the meeting leader can pose questions to the group, instantly collect their feedback, and, with the help of the governing software loaded on the control station, process this feedback into meaningful information to aid in the decision-making process.

## Executive Support Systems
