## [[2nd Year/(COSC 55) Discrete Structure 2/Midterm/Probability]]
- The number of ways of achieving success, the total number of possible outcomes. 
- For example, the **probability** of flipping a coin and it being heads is 1/2, because there is 1 way of getting a head and the total number of possible outcomes is 2 (a head or tail). We write P(heads) = 1/2

## Combinatorics
- Is the branch of mathematics studying the enumeration, combination, and permutation of sets of elements and the mathematical relations that characterize their properties. 
- Mathematicians sometimes use the term "combinatorics" to refer to a larger subset of discrete mathematics that includes graph theory.

## Algorithm
- In its purest sense, an algorithm is a mathematical process to solve a problem using a finite number of steps.
- In the world of computers, an algorithm is the set of instructions that defines not just what needs to be done but how to do it.
