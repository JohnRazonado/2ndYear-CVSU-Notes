- Known as **counting rule**. 
- A way to figure out the number of outcomes in a probability problem.
- Basically, you multiply the events together to get the total number of outcomes.

>If you have an event “a” and another event “b” then all the different outcomes for the events is a * b.
>
>The Fundamental Counting Principle is also "**The Multiplication Counting Rule**"

## Combination
- In general, n objects can be arranged in n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... (3)(2)(1) ways. This product is represented by the symbol n!, which is called n factorial. (By convention, 0! = 1.)
- A combination is a selection of all or part of a set of objects, without regard to the order in which they were selected. This means that XYZ is considered the same combination as ZYX.
- The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is denoted by

## Permutation
- A permutation is an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, with regard to the order of the arrangement. This means that XYZ is considered a different permutation than ZYX.
