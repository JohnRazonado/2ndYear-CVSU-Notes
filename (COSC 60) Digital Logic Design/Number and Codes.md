#### Digits
- A number on each odometer wheel are called *digits*
- Uses decimal number system (0-9)

#### Strings
- Group of characters (could be digits or letters)
- 734 could be a string. Also, 2c8A is also a string

#### Binary
- Means **two**
- Only use **1** and **0**
- The fundamentals of all computers

## How Binary is used
- Since it is the fundamentals of computer and computing itself
### Bit
- Abbreviation for *binary digit* 
	- 1100 has 4 bits
	- 11001100 has 8 bits

### BCD
- Binary Coded Decimal
- uses nibble, a 4-bit string.
- 2945 converts into 0010 1001 0100 0101

- Useful when decimal information is transferred into or out of a digital system.
- Uses also for alpanumerics

### ASCII
- American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- Implies some kind of alphanumeric code of the I/O unit of a computer.
![[Pasted image 20221116091158.png]]

**Alphanumeric**- Letters, number, and other symbols.

#### Program
- List of instructions telling the computer what to do
- Instructions spell out each and every step in the data processing.
- The program must be coded in binary form before it goes into the computer.

#### Data
- The names, numbers, facts, anything needed to work out in a problem.
- It is processed or manipulated to get a new [[Chapter 1- Introduction to Information Systems and Organization#Information Concepts|information]]

#### Hardware
- Mechanical device of a computer

#### Software
- The program itself
- Computers would be a pile of "dumb" without it.

### Memory
- One of the main parts of computers.
- ``

## Transistors
- Main reason why computer works
- **integrated circuits (IC)** contains thousands of these used by computers (but it is now  in the millions in terms of the modern computers).
- IC still works with *transistor variations* due to its **two-state design**
	- using only two points on the load line of each transistor.
	- When a transistors on the left are cut off or saturated, parameter variations have almost no effect.

### Transistor Register
- A **register** is a string of devices that store data
- The transistors on the left of the diagram are cut off because that input base voltages are 0 V. (Dark shading symbolized the cutoff condition).

### Magnetic cores
- Early digital computers used this magnetic cores
- The cores have rectangular hysteresis loops
	- the flux remains in a core even though the magnetizing current is removed

## Microprocessors
- Noting more than a CPU on a chip
	- CPU (central processing unit) often combined the control and ALU section into a single unit.
### Microcomputer
- Literally a *small computer*
- Specifically a computer that uses microprocessors for its CPU.
- Composing three kinds of chips
	- Microprocessor (as CPU)
	- Memory (several chips)
	- I/O (one or more chips)
- For instance, the 8048 Intel is a one-chip microcomputer with an 8-bit CPU, 1088 bytes of memory, and 27 I/O lines.

### Computer
#### Input
- consists of all the circuits needed to get programs and data into the computer
#### Memory
- Stores program and data before the computer run begins.
#### Control
- Computer's center of gravity, analogous to the conscious part of the mind. Tells other section what to do and when to do it.
#### Arithmetic and Logic
- Number-crunching section of the machine.
- Also make logical decisions.
	- Grinding out answers to number and logic problems.
#### Output
- Passes answers to the outside world.
- Usually include a video display allowing user to see the processed data.

## Conversions
### Base or Radix
- way to know the number of digits a number system has
- 100<sub>2</sub> means it is a binary
- 100<sub>10</sub> means a decimal 100
