It is part of the process of Requirement Engineering and one of the initial method to do.

- Standish Group listed “Lack of User Input” as most common factor of challenged projects.
- Requirements Elicitation is the process of discovering the requirements for a system by communication with customers, system users and others who have a stake in the system development.
- Development teams have to take the initiative.
>We have all been part of projects where developers say things like “When will marketing (or user) supply us with the requirements that we need. That way we can do what we like to do, code.”  In the real world I (M. Madigan) have never seen this happen.  In fact with experience I have found that this is undesirable.  Rather a successful project will find a way for both users (marketing) and engineers to work together to elicit and manage requirements.

## Challenges of Requirement Elicitation
- The “Yes, But” syndrome stems from human nature and the users inability to experience the software as they might a physical device.
- The Undiscovered Ruins, the more you find, the more you realize still remain
- “User and Developer” syndrome reflects the profound differences between the two, making communication difficult.
- “The sins of your predecessors” syndrome where marketing (user) and developers do not trust each other based on previous interactions, so marketing wants everything and developers commit to nothing.

### "Yet, But" Syndrome
- First time users see the system the first reaction is either, “wow this is so cool” or  “Yes, but, hmmmmm, now that I see it, what about this…?  Wouldn’t it be nice" 
- Users reaction is simply human nature
- Need to employ techniques that get the “yes, buts” out early.
- Anticipate that there will be “yes, buts” and add time and resources to plan for feedback.
- Tends to be User Interface centric, these tend to be the touch points of the system by the users.

### "Undiscovered Ruins" Syndrome
- Teams struggle with determining when they are done with requirements elicitation.
	- Is done when all the requirements are elicited or have they found at least enough?
	- Like asking an archeologist “how many undiscovered ruins are there?”
	   
- First scope the requirements elicitation effort by defining the problem or problems that are to be solved with the system.
- Employ techniques that help find some of those ruins and have the stakeholders buy-into the requirements.

> More or less feeling stuck of not discovering everything needed to scope in a project. Feeling of missing some pieces on a jigsaw puzzle.

### "User and Developer" Syndrome
#### Charactetistic
- Users do not know what they want, or they know what they want but cannot articulate it.
- Users think they know what they want until developers give them what they said they wanted.
- Analysts think they understand user problems better than users do.
- Everybody believes everybody else is politically motivated.

#### Response
- Recognize and appreciate the user as domain experts; try different techniques.
- Provide alternative elicitation techniques earlier; storyboard, role playing, prototypes, and so on.
- Put the analyst in the users place.  Try role playing for an hour or a day.
- Yes, its part of human nature, so lets get on with the program.

### "Living with the Sins of your predecessors" Syndrome
- Like it or not your users (marketing) and developers remember what happened in the past.
	- Quality programs that promised things would be different.
	- The last project where requirements were vague and/or were delivered short of expectations.

- The team “unilaterally” cut important features out of the last release.
- Need to build trust, slowly.  Do not over commit to features, schedule, or budget.
- Build success by delivering highest priority features early in the process.

## Requirements Elicitation Techniques
> Read all the headings for enumeration
### Interviewing and questionnaires
- Simple direct technique
- Context-free questions can help achieve bias-free interviews – See course web site for examples
- Then, it may be appropriate to search for undiscovered requirements by exploring solutions.
- Convergence on some common needs will initiate a “requirements repository” for use during the project.
- A questionnaire is no substitute for an interview.

#### Context Free Questions
- Goal is to prevent prejudicing the user’s response to the questions.
  Examples:
	- Who is the user?
	- Who is the customer?
	- Are their needs different?
	- Where else can a solution to this problem be found?
- Context-free questions also parallel the questions salespeople are taught to ask as part of a technique called “solutions selling.”
- After context-free questions are asked, suggested solutions can be explored.

#### Show Time
- Establish Customer or User Profile
- Assessing the Problem
- Understanding the User Environment
- Recap the Understanding
- Analyst’s Inputs on Customer’s Problems
- Assessing Your Solution (if applicable)

### Requirements workshops
- The requirements workshop is perhaps the most powerful technique for eliciting requirements.
- It gathers all key stakeholders together for a short but intensely focused period.
- The use of an outside facilitator experienced in requirements management can ensure the success of the workshop.
- Brainstorming is the most important part of the workshop.

#### Preparing for the Workshop
- Selling the workshop concept to stakeholders
- Ensuring the Participation of the Right Stakeholders
- Logistics
	- Try and prevent Murphy’s law
	- Includes travel, lighting, and even “afternoon sugar filled snacks.”

- Warm-up materials
	- Project-specific information
	- Out-of-box thinking preparation

#### Role of the Facilitator
- Establish professional and objective tone to the meeting.
- Start and stop the meeting on time.
- Establish and enforce the “rules” for the meeting.
- Introduce the goals and agenda for the meeting.
- Manage the meeting and keep the team “on track.”
- Facilitate a process of decision and consensus making, but avoid participating in the content.
- Make certain that all stakeholders participate and have their input heard.
- Control disruptive or unproductive behavior.

### Workshop Agenda
- Set an agenda before the workshop and publish it along with the other pre-workshop documentation.
- Balance is the key, try to stay on the agenda, but do not strictly obey it, especially if good discussion is going on.
- Order lunch in, and have a *light* working lunch :)

#### Running the Workshop
- Allow for human behavior, and have fun with it.
	- Do not “attack” other members.
	- Do not get on a soap box.
	- Do not come back late from a break.
- Workshop tickets
	- Give every stakeholder 3 workshop tickets
	- 1 for being late
	- 1 for “cheap shot”
	- 1 for “soap box”
>Facilitator takes tickets when appropriate.  If you do not have a ticket create a fund to add to, like $1 to pot for after workshop activities.

#### Workshop Problems and Suggestions
##### Time Management
Facilitator keeps a timer for all breaks and fines anyone that is late, everyone gets one free pass.
- It’s difficult to get going after breaks and lunch.
- Key shareholders may be late returning
##### Grandstanding, domineering positions
Everyone gets one 5 minute position statement.
##### Lack of input from stakeholders
Facilitator encourages everyone to use 5-minute position and great idea ticket.
##### Negative comments petty behaviors, and turf wars
Use **Cheap shot tickets**, all others cost money.
##### Flagging energy after lunch
Lite lunches, afternoon breaks, rearrange seating

>What does this have to do with engineering?  **Everything**.  So far, the only creatures we have found to use as engineers are people.  Same goes for marketing, testing, strategic planning, etc.
>
>The engineer’s tendency to shy away from actions needed to encourage, cajole, and motivate humans to be productive leads to unproductive meetings.

#### Requirements Elicitation Guidelines
- Assess System *Feasibility*
- Be sensitive to *organizational* and *political* considerations
- Identify and consult system *stakeholders*
- Record requirements *sources*
- Use *Business concerns* to drive requirements elicitation
- Look for *domain constraints*
- Record requirements *rationale*
- Collect requirements from *multiple viewpoints*
- *Prototype* poorly understood requirements
- Use *scenarios* to elicit requirements
- Define *operational processes*
- *Reuse* requirements

#### Identify and Consult System Stakeholders
If lacking consideration of *everyone who is likely to be affected* by the introduction of the system, there is a great likelihood of missing some critical requirements.

“Identifying stakeholders and discussing the system with them makes people feel like they are part of the requirements elicitation process.  In fact, it makes them a part of it.”

#### Use Business Concerns to Drive Requiments Elicitation
If a system is to be useful, it must *contribute to the key concerns of the business*.  If the concerns are identified and used as drivers of the requirements elicitation process, there will be *higher confidence that the system will meet real organization needs*.

Making the business concerns *explicit* helps to focus and clarify these goals.

#### Collect Requirements from Multiple Viewpoints
If requirements are collected from a single viewpoint, they are *unlikely to meet* other stakeholders’ requirements.

Collecting requirements from multiple viewpoints is a useful way to *prioritize* requirements

Identified viewpoints can be used to help
- organize requirements elicitation and
- organize the requirements specification, too.

#### Reuse Requirements
Saves money and time.  Studies have shown that similar systems can re-use up to 80% of the requirements.

Reuse reduces risk.  Reused requirements have a *better chance of being understood* by all the stakeholders.

Requirements reuse may lead to additional reuse in other lifecycle activities.
- Component design
- Tests
- Code



### Braining Storming and idea reduction
Brainstorming involves both idea generation and idea reduction.
- The most creative, innovative ideas often result from combining, seemingly unrelated ideas.
- Various voting techniques may be used to prioritize the ideas created.
- Although live brainstorming is preferred, web-based brainstorming may be a viable alternative in some situations

#### Rules for Brainstorming
- Do not allow criticism or debate.
- Let your imagination soar
- Generate as many ideas as possible
- Mutate and combine ideas
- Idea Reduction
	- Pruning ideas that are not worthy of further discussion
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Grouping of similar ideas into one super topic</mark>
- Prioritize the remaining ideas

### Storyboards
- The purpose of storyboarding is to elicit early “Yes, But” reactions.
- Storyboards can be positive, active, or inactive.
- Storyboards identify the players, explain what happens to them, and describes how it happens.
- Make the storyboard sketchy, easy to modify, and unshippable.
- Storyboard early and often on every project with new or innovative content.

### Use Cases
- Use Cases, like storyboards, identify the who, what, and how of system behavior.
- Use Cases describe the interactions between a user and a system, focusing on what they system “does” for the user.
- The Use Case model describes the totality of the systems functional behavior.

Early stages:  After you have an overview of the use cases, perhaps only by a phrase apiece, expand 10% of them in detail.
More later …

>Weakness of Use Cases -- we miss the “ilities”, the quality attributes.
Those must be addressed explicitly eventually.

### Role Playing (Variant on Use Cases)
- Role playing allows stakeholders to experience the user’s world from the user’s perspective.
- A scripted walkthrough may replace role playing in some situations, with the script becoming a live storyboard.  
- (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration (CRC) cards, often used in object-oriented analysis, are a derivative of role playing.)

### Prototyping
- Prototyping is especially effective in addressing the “Yes, But” and the “Undiscovered Ruins” syndromes.
- A software requirements prototype is a partial implementation of a software system, built to help developers, users, and customers better understand system requirements.
- Prototype the “fuzzy” requirements: those that, although known or implied, are poorly defined and poorly understood.
