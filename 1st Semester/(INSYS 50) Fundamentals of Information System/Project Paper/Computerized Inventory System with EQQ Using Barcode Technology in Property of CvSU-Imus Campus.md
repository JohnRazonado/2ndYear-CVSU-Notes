> Uses SDLC (System Development Life Cycle)

#### Methodology
This paper uses different data flow diagram to describe most of the program's processes. It also shows the flow of hardware from the barcode scanner, to the computer, and lastly the printer.

The project development side uses a **V-model** which is a software development process combining elements of both design and prototyping-in-stages, combining the top-down and bottom-up concepts. This is a SDLC concept as well.

Along with that is also having a testing phase with alpha and beta testing present in the project.
