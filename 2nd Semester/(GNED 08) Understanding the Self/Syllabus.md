## [[Lesson 1 - Perspective of Philosophy|Perspective of Philosophy]]
- Thinkers for centuries have searched for explanation and reasons for everything that exist around him.
- Athens of Ancient Greece
	- around 600 BCE marked the **Birth of Philosophy**
	- Question centered on universe and **what possible role man play in it.**
	- Answers came up that both cognitive and scientific in nature
	- Greek philosophers in Miletus
		- Seek natural explanation to event and phenomena around him as opposed to what gods explanation through passed generations.
		- Their study of change led to **Idea of permanence**.
- Questions centered on the inner world of a man: 
	- Who am I?
	- Why am I here?
	- What do I want out of life?

### Socrates (470-399 BCE)
- One of the three **Great Greek Triumvirate**, along with Plato and Aristotle
- Socrates was the mentor of Plato, and Plato was the mentor of Aristotle.
#### Athens
- Center of Western thought
- 5th Century BCE, enjoyed status being city state and a democracy.
- Athenians settle arguments by discussion and debate
	- Skilled people doing this were called ***Sophists***, first teacher of West.

#### Socrates life
- Stonemason with a sharp mind
- He did not write anything but lots of his thoughts were only known due to **Plato's writing**
- He was a brilliant debater and idolized by many Athenians
- **Angered many Sophists** which led to his demise bringing him to trial and finally **sentenced to death**

#### Socratic Method
- Discovering what's essential in the world and in people
- Known also as "Dialectic method"
- Methods search for the correct/proper definition of a thing
- He didn't lecture but **would ask questions and engage the person in a discussion**
	- Acting as if he didn't know anything and get the other person clarify their ideas
	- The goal is to bring the person closer to final understanding

> **“I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think.”**

- He fully lived by his famous statement **´the unexamined life is not worth living.’**
- Believing that his mission was to seek highest knowledge and convince others to follow suite.
- Helping people to touch the **true self**, it is not the body but the soul.
- Virtue is inner goodness, and real beauty is that of the soul.
- **Delphi Oracle** name Socrates **the wisest of all men** which he became confused
	- But meant people are ignorant to most important knowledge: **how to live right and how to make their soul good.**
	- Because he was the only one who knew that he didn't know
- The Socratic method important part is to **realized that they do not know everything** as real understanding comes from within the present.

### Plato (428-348 BCE)
- Real name **Aristocles**
- Born in Athens, son of Ariston which one of Greece's aristocratic families.
- Nicknamed **Plato** due to his physique which means "**wide/broad**"
- He left Athens 12 years after death of Socrates and returned to established a school "**The Academy**"
- Plato and Socrates believed philosophy is more than analyses but rather way of life.

#### Plato's Metaphysics: Theory of Forms
- Forms are what are real.
- Plato's forms have the following characteristics
	1. The Forms are ageless and therefore eternal.
	2. The Forms are unchanging and therefore permanent.
	3. The Forms are unmoving and indivisible.

- This is also inclined with Plato's two realms, Plato's Dualism:
	1. **The Realm of the** **Shadows** is composed of changing, ‘sensible’ things which are lesser entities and therefore imperfect and flawed.
	2. **The Realm of Forms** is composed of eternal things which are permanent and perfect. It is the source of all reality and true knowledge.

#### Components of Souls
1. **The Reason** is rational and is the motivation are for goodness and truth.
	- Seeks the true goal of man
1. **The Spirited** is non-rational and is the will or the drive toward action. This part of the soul is initially neutral but can be influenced/pulled in two directions.
2. **The Appetites** are irrational and lean towards the desire for pleasures of the body.

> Spirited and the Appetites want worldly pleasures and can influence reason by making it believe that sensual pleasures are the source of happiness.

To which Plato believes that people are intrinsically good but judgements are main in ignorance which Plato equates with **Evil**.

#### Plato's Theory of Love and Becoming
##### Allegory of Cave
- Illustration as part of is philosophy for search of knowledge.
- People in the cave see are only shadows of reality which they believe are real things and represents knowledge.
- Shadows are not real, for according to Plato, ‘only the Forms are real.’
- If people get out of the cave and into the light, they'll realize that Forms which is what real knowledge is. 
- **To know for Plato is to be**
- In Plato's Symposium, **love** is the way to get out of the cave, moving from imperfect knowledge and ignorance to **state of perfection and true knowledge**
- **Love** is feeling of feeling that there's lacking, seek for which is lacking. The deeper the thought, the stronger the love.
	- Love is way of knowing and realizing truth.
	- It is the process of seeking higher states of being.

>The next part of this enters the "DARK AGES" where Catholics deems to religions are the truth to which the church can only perpetuate the "truth"
---

### St. Augustine of Hippo
- Christianity’s influence dominated Western thought after the fall of the Hellenistic-Roman eras.
- Christian philosophers did not believe that self-knowledge and happiness were the ultimate goals of man but instead man should rely on God’s commands and his judgment of what constitutes good and evil.
- Christianity sees man as sinners who reject/go against a loving God’s commands
- Christian philosophy is so powerful that they ordered Plato's Academy in Athens closed.

- St. Augustine of Hippo initially rejected Christianity due to believed that it can provide the answers to questions interest him. 
	- To know moral evil, personal desire for sensual pleasure and questions about suffering in the world.
- He became priest and a bishop of Hippo then proposed two realms:
1. **God as the source of all reality and truth.** Without God as the source of all the truth, **man could never understand eternal truths**. So God means that those who know most about God will come closest to understanding the true nature of the world.

2. **The sinfulness of man.** Cause of **sin or evil** is an act of **man’s freewill**. Evil, therefore, does not live in God’s creatures but rather in man. **Moral goodness** can only be achieved through the **grace of God.**

#### Role of Love
-  Real happiness can only be found in God.
- **God is love** and he created humans for them to also love
-  Disordered love results when **man loves the wrong things**

He explains:
1. Love of **physical objects** leads to the **sin of greed**.
2. Love for **other people is not lasting** and **excessive love** for them is the **sin of jealousy**.
3. **Love for the self** leads to the **sin of pride**.
4. **Love for God** is the supreme virtue and only through loving God can man **find real happiness**.

>This part is the Renaissance era
---
### Rene Descartes
- Father of Modern Philosophy
- Introduced *Cartesian method* and invented *analytic geometry* (blame him for our suffering).
- Asked himself "‘is there anything I can know with certainty?"
- Which through math, he discovered **human mind has two powers:**
	1. **Intuition**  or the ability to apprehend direction of certain truths and,
	2. **Deduction** or the power to discover what is known by progressing in an orderly way from what is already known. Truths are arrived at using a step by step process.
- Descartes believed that reasoning could produce absolute truths about nature, existence, morality and God.
- The truths that can be discovered are a priori.
- **‘I think, therefore I am.’** (Cogito Ergo Sum) This phrase is Descartes’ legacy
- He believes, **to doubt is to think**.
- Descartes considered the **soul/mind (also the self)** as a substance that is separate from the body.
-  Machine that is controlled by the will and aided by the mind.

### John Locke
- Locke believed that **knowledge results** from ideas produced a _posteriori_ or by objects that were experienced. 
- Locke contended that ideas are not innate but rather the mind at birth is a _‘tabula rasa’_.
- “nothing exists in the mind that was **not first in the senses.**”_ What the senses have experienced are simple ideas which are the raw materials from which knowledge begins. 
- Mental acts, for instance are acts that produce the ‘greatest possible good’ but contended that knowing what is good does not necessarily mean that people will always do what is good. Morality has to do with choosing or willing the good.

Moral good depends of some law, there are three laws:
1. **Law of opinion** – where actions that are praiseworthy are called virtues and those that are not are called vice.
2. **Civil Law** – where right actions are enforced by people in authority (i.e., courts and police)
3. **Divine Law –** set by God on the actions of man. This is deemed to be the true law for human behaviour. The divine law is eternally true and the one law that man should always follow.

### David Hume
- enrolled at the University of Edinburgh
- As he examined the process of how ideas are formed, he discovered the limitations of the mind and his optimism turned into scepticism.

Hume’s analysis proceeded this way: the mind receives materials from the senses and calls it perceptions. Two types of perceptions according to Hume:
1. **Impression** are the immediate sensations of external reality. These are more vivid than the ideas it produces.
2. **Ideas** are recollections of these impressions.

>These two together make up the content of the human mind. It all begins with impressions. Without impressions, there will be no formation of ideas.  Imagination connect two ideas to form complex idea.

The self is nothing else but a bundle of impressions. What is the Self then? Self, is simply “a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement”

### Immanuel Kant
- Mind isn't just passive receiver but actively participates in knowing the objects it experience. 
- external world that conforms to the mind
- _The things that men perceive around them are not just randomly infused into the human person without an organizing **principle that regulates the relationship of all these impressions.**_
- **Self is not just what gives one personality.** In addition, it is also the seat of knowledge acquisition for all human persons.
-  Therefore, a **self must exist**, according to Kant or there could be no memory or knowledge. 
	- The term he used for this experience of the self and its unity with objects is _**transcendental apperception**._

### Sigmund Freud
-  human behaviour pave the way for science to look into the **workings of the unconscious mind**.
-  Kept hidden and unexpressed, these repressed memories resurface and are manifested as some form of **psychopathology (_hysteria_)**. 
- In Freud’s clinical practice, therapy involves several techniques that would help the person recognized these thoughts and thus bring him back to emotional stability. Freud made use of methods like **_free association_ and _dream analysis._**

#### Structures of the Mind
- Freud presented the _topography of the mind_. He made use of a typical iceberg to show how the mind works based on his theorizing. The tip of the iceberg represents conscious awareness which characterizes the person as he deals with his external world. 
- subconscious serves as repository of past experiences, repressed memories, fantasies and urges. The three levels of the mind are structured by the following components:
	1. **Id** – The structure that is primarily based on the _pleasure principle_. It demands immediate satisfaction and is not hindered by societal expectations.
	2. **Ego –** The structure that is based on the reality principle. This structure mediates between the impulses of the id and the restraints of the superego.
	3. **Superego –** The last structure to develop and is primarily dependent on learning the difference between right and wrong. Morality of actions is largely dependent on childhood upbringing particularly on rewards and punishments.

- Two kinds of instincts that drive individual behavior
	- **Eros** -  life instinct. energy of _eros_ is called _libido_ and includes urges necessary for individual and species survival like thirst, hunger and sex
	- **Thanatos** - death instinct.  Man’s behaviour is directed towards destruction in the form of aggression and violence.

- Man then lives his life balancing the forces of life and death

### Gilbert Ryle
- English philosopher whose ideas contradicted Cartesian Dualism
- book entitled, _The concept of the Mind,_ Ryle argues that dualism ‘involves category mistakes and is a philosophical nonsense’
-  One can roam around the campus, visit the library and the football field, and meet the administrators and faculty and still end up not finding the “university.” This is because the **campus, the people, the system, and the territory all form the university**.
- *self* is not an entity one can locate and analyse but simply the **convenient name that the people use to refer to all the behaviours** that people make.

#### Two types of Knowledge
- Knowing-that
	-  knowing facts/information
	- knowing that’ is considered as empty intellectualism.
- Knowing-how
	- using facts in the performance of some skill or technical abilities
	-  important is how to make use of these facts. A person may acquire a great bulk of knowledge – but without the ability to use it to solve some practical problems to make his life easier

### Patricia and Paul Churchland
- inquiry looks into the application of neurology to age-old problems in philosophy, **mind-body problem**
	-  known as _neurophilosophy_.
- man’s brain is responsible for the identity known as the self
- It seems that what and who the person is – how he makes decisions, control impulses and how he sees himself is largely determined by his neurons, hormones and overall genetic make-up.

>These data provide information on how normal brain functioning facilitates accepted social behaviour and how a compromised brain gives rise to aberrant behaviour patterns.

## MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY
-  concept of body-subject and contended that perceptions occur existentially.
-  **world is a field of perception**, and human consciousness **assigns meaning to the world.**
- perception is not purely the result of sensations nor is it purely interpretation.
-  What happens then is, the body seeks clarity for the meaning of this object by constituting a perceptual gestalt (German word for ‘good form’).
- The focus is on the relationship between self-experience and the experience of other people.

## [[Perspective of Sociology|Sociological Perspective]]
### What is the self
Commonly defined by following characteristics: **separate**, **self-contained**, **independent**, **consistent**, **unitary**, and **private**.
- **Separate** - self is distinct from the other selves, unique, and has its own identity. Even twins are distinct from each other.
- **Self-contained** and **independent** - in itself it can exist. Its distinctness allows it to be self-contained with its own thoughts, characteristics and volition. Not requiring other self for it to exist.
- **Consistent** - Personality that is enduring and therefore can be expected to persist for quite some time. Particular self’s traits, characteristics, tendencies and potentialities are more or less the same.
- **Unitary** - center of all experiences and thoughts that run through a certain person. A chief command post in an individual.
- **Private** - Sorts out information, feelings, and emotions, and thought processes within the self. This process is never accessible to anyone but the self.

>self being private suggests that the self is isolated from the external world. It lives within its own world. However, we also see that this potential clash between the self and the external reality is the reason for the self to have a clear understanding of what it might be, what it can be, and what it will be.

Social constructionists argue for a merged view of “the person” and their “local social context” where the boundaries of one cannot easily be separated from the boundaries of the other. **Social constructivist** argue that the self should not be seen as a static entity that stays constant through and through. 

#### The Self and Culture
##### Marcel Mauss
- French Anthropologist
- Every self has two faces: personne and moi
	- **Moi** - a _person’s sense of who he is_, his body, and his basic identity, his biological givenness. Person's basic identity
	- **Personne** - composed of the social concepts of what it means to be who he is. It has much to do with what it means to live in a particular institution, a particular family, a particular region, a particular nationality, and how to behave given expectations and influences from others..

>**_“The self is capable of morphing and fitting itself into any circumstances it finds itself in.”_**

### Self and the Development of the Social World
#### George Herbert Mead
- Born: February 1863, Massachusetts, USA
- Graduated and taught grade school at Oberlin College
- Enrolled at Harvard University (1887)
- During the span of his career, he wrote and published many articles and book reviews but did not publish any book.
- It was his students who put together his numerous writings and edited them for publication.
- Died: Heart failure in 1931

##### Mead's Social Self
- **Social Behaviorism** - approached used to describe the power of the environment in shaping human behaviour.
	- Described the self as a _‘dimension of personality that is made-up of the individual’s self-awareness and self-image’_ (Macionis, 2012).
- Mead explains set of stages which person undergoes course of his development:
|STAGES|EXISTENCE OF SELF| CHARACTERISTICS|
|---|---|---|
|**Preparatory Stage**| None| Imitates another|
|**Play Stage**| Developing| Role-taking|
|**Game Stage**| Present| Generalized other|

1. **Preparatory Stage**
	- Mead believed **self didn't exist at birth**, it develops over time. Its development depends on social interaction and social experience.
	- This stage, children's behaviour primarily based on ***imitation***.
	- At the first stage, knowing and understanding the symbols are important for this will constitute their way of communicating with others throughout their lives. The symbol are the bases of communication. 
1. **Play Stage**
	- Skills at knowing and understanding the symbols of communication is important, for this constitutes the basis for socialization (to form social relationships)
	- Children begin to **role play** and pretend to be other people. 
		- This process mentally assuming the perspective of another person seeing how it might behave or respond.
	- This stage show child to widens his perspective and realizes that he's not alone and there are others whose presence has to consider. 
1. **Game Stage**
	- Age: about eight (8) or nine (9) years and more than just role-take
	- Child begins to consider several tasks and various types of relationships simultaneously.
	- Child now has ability to respond on several members of social environment
	- **Generalized other**
		- Explain the behavior of the person when he sees/consider other people in the course of action.
		- People in society have cultural norms, beliefs and values which are incorporated into each self. This realization forms the basis of self-evaluation

##### MEAD's Theory of the Self
- Self is not present at birth but at child's world. Where children sees themselves as the center of their **Universe** having difficulty understanding others around.
- There's a change of self as grow and mature.  Begins to see other people and concerned about people's reaction. There are ***significant others*** who strongly influence his development like his family.

##### The "I" and "ME"
- the person’s capacity to see the self through others implies that the self is composed of two parts: **"I"** and **"Me"** self
- **I Self** - When the person initiates or performs a social action, the self, functions as a subject. This subjective element of the self is I.
	- I will go on a date. I will cook dinner tonight.
- **Me Self** - When the person takes the role of the other functioning as an object. The objective element of the self is Me.
	- The choice for the best drawing was awarded to me.
- Though the self doesn't end in process of socialization, it continues as long as person live.
- Self may change on life circumstances that has strong impact. Person may have no control over event but it can **control how he/she reacts and deals** which still an important aspect of the self.

#### Charles Horton Cooley (1864-1929)
- American sociologist
- Made use of **_sociopsychological approach_** to understanding how societies work.
- Earned his doctorate at the University of Michigan and taught at the same university as a sociology professor.
- Discussed the formation of the self through interaction _(Human Nature and the Social Order, 1902)_
- People learn who they are through their social interaction with other people. View of the self is also significantly influenced by the impression and perception of others.
	- Calling this ***looking-glass self*** or self that is a product of social interaction. Cooley believed that process of developing self has three phases:
1. **People imagine how they present themselves to others**
	```
	You dress-up elegantly for the prom.
	You greet your teachers politely in the school’s hallway.
	```
2. **People imagine how others evaluate them**.
	```
	Others will see you as pretty and attractive by the way you fix yourself.
	Others will see you as courteous and well-bred.
	```

3. **People develop some sort of feeling about themselves as a result of those impressions.**
	```
	You may see yourself as confident or inferior.
	```

Cooley made use the word **image** implying that people develop **self-identities based on *wrong perception* on how others see them**.

>I am not what **I** think I am
I am not what **You** think I am
I am what **I** think **You** think I am

#### Erving Goffman (1922-1982)
- Canadian-American sociologist
-   Known for his role in the development of Modern American Sociology
-   In his work, _The Presentation of the Self in Everyday Life,_  observed that people early in their social interactions learned to **_slant_** their presentation of themselves in order to create preferred appearances and satisfy particular people.
-   **Impression management** – the process of altering how the person presents himself to others.
-   He sees similarities of real social interaction to a theatrical presentation. This is the reason for the label **_dramaturgical approach_** to his view.
-   **_Face-work_** - a phrase used to describe another aspect of the self. This was usually observed in situations where face-saving measures are resorted to in the maintenance of a proper image of the self in frustrating or embarrassing situations.

### Self in Families
- the impact of one’s family is still deemed as a given in understanding the self. 
- The kind of family that we are born in, the resources available to us, and the kind of development that we will have certainly affect us as we go through our life.
- Human beings are born virtually helpless and the dependency period of a human baby to its parents for nurturing is relatively longer than most other animals. 
- Learning therefore is critical in our capacity to actualize our potential of becoming humans.
- Child enters system of relationships, most important is **family**
	- Imitation of Language and Behavior

### Gender and the self
- Gender is one of those loci of the self that is subject to alteration, change and development.
- Nancy Chodorow, a feminist, argues that because mothers take the role of taking care of children, there is a tendency for girls to imitate the same and reproduce the same kind of mentality of women as care providers in the family.
- Men on the other hand, in the periphery of their own family, are taught early on how to behave like a man. This normally includes holding in one’s emotion, being tough, fatalistic, not to worry about danger, and admiration for hard physical labor. Masculinity is learned by integrating a young boy in a society.
	- Bois in Philippines has to undergo circumcision(aka tuli) not just for clinical purpose but to also assert manliness in society.
- The gendered self is then shaped within a particular context of time and space. The sense of self that is being taught makes sure that an individual fits in a particular environment
- Gender has to be personally discovered and asserted and not dictated by culture and society.

## [[Antropological Perspective]]
- Field of social sciences that focuses on the **study of man**. Doesn't pertain only to one aspect of man (i.e. his mind or his environment) but on the **totality of men**
- Field looks into man’s physical/biological characteristics, his social relationships and the influences of his culture from the dawn of civilization up to the present.

**“What man is now, is a product of his past”**

Four Subfields of anthropology:
1. Archaeology  
2. Linguistics
3. Biological Anthropology
4. Cultural Anthropology

### [[Antropological Perspective#Archaeology|Archaeology]]
- Archaeologists' focus is the past and how it may have contributed to the present ways of how people conduct their daily lives. 
- Man’s big brains have allowed them to think and look for ways to prolong their existence.
- Some men would use power and strength, declare wars, conquer and even try to annihilate races, while others would offer their services, knowledge, resources and even their lives just to ensure that a few deserving human beings would survive. Indeed, people are so similar and yet so different.
	- They use adaptation to ensure that they will survive.


### [[Antropological Perspective#Biological Anthropology|Biological Anthropology]]
- Focus primarily on how the human body adapts to the different earth environments. They look at the probable causes of disease, physical mutation and death. 
- Do comparative studies on human beings both dead and living and other primates (apes and monkeys).

**Biological characteristics human beings share may earn for them complete dominion over all earth creatures and at the same time be the cause of their extinction.**
>A cure during a pandemic (a cure effective for one may have similar effects on others). The virus, Anthrax ( which is lethal for one will be as lethal for many)

### [[Antropological Perspective#Linguistic Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology]]
- **Human survival is primarily linked to their ability to communicate**
	- Human survival => ability to communicate
- An essential part of human communication is language.
- Language identifies a group of people. 
	- The words, sounds, symbols, writings and signs that are used are reflections of a group’s culture.
>That's why there exist an accent and difference between US-English and Brittish-English

### [[Antropological Perspective#Cultural Anthropology|Cultural Anthropology]]
- Culture is described as a group of people’s way of life.
	- Includes behaviors, beliefs, values, and symbols transmitted socially through generation
- **Cultural anthropologists** are interested in knowing what makes one group’s manner of living particular to that group and forms an essential part of the member’s personal and social identity.
-  **Theory of Cultural Determinism** –  Human *nature is determined by the ideas, meanings, beliefs and values* learned as members of a society.
	- This theory has a positive and negative implications
	- **The positive** - human beings can be shaped/formed to have the kind of life they prefer. There's no limit placed and humans can do what they set their minds and hearts to.
	- **The negative** - People have no control over what they learn. They blindly accept the learning their cultures expose them to. Human beings are seen as helpless and do only what their culture instructs them to do. 
- **Symbols** are considered the most **superficial level of culture and values belong to the deepest level** or are considered the **core of culture**.
- Following culture that can manifest:
	1. **Symbols**
		- Are the words, gestures, pictures or objects that have a recognized/accepted meaning in a particular culture. Can be shared or copied by other cultures who find them also fitting for their own culture.
	2. **Rituals**
		- Activities participated in by a group of people for the fulfilment of desired objectives and are considered to be socially essential.
		- **Religious ceremonies** (a formal rituals) like baptisms and weddings, and **Social ceremonies** (can be informal and less restrictive structure than religious ceremonies) like birthday and graduations are example of this.
	3. **Heroes**
		- Persons from the past or present who have characteristics that are important in a culture
		- Can be real or fictitious and models for behavior
	4. **Values**
		- Core of every culture
		-  Values are unconscious and can neither be discussed nor be directly observed but can only be **inferred from the way people act and react to circumstances and situation**.


## [[Psychological Perspective]]
### Psychology
- Field of the social sciences that deals with the description, explanation, prediction and control of behavior. 
- The study of human behavior connect to the concept of the self.

### William James
- American Philosopher and Psychologist
- A professor of psychologist and philosophy at Harvard University and **known as the greatest pragmatist**
- He is also known for his **Theory of the Self**
- He is the author of the book titled *“The Principles of Psychology"* where his theory was explained

#### Five Characteristics of Human Thoughts
1. All human thoughts are owned by some personal self.
2. All thoughts are **constantly changing or never static**.
3. There is a continuity of thoughts as its focus shifts from one object to another.
4. Thoughts deal with objects that are different from an independent of consciousness itself.
5. Consciousness can focus on particular objects and not others.

>In the end, thoughts are associated with existence of the self.

#### The "Me" and "I"
James believes that self is compose of these two: **ME** self and **I** self
- **ME self** - considered as a separate object or individual that the person refers to when discussing or describing their personal experience.
	- The ME self appears to **empirical ME** which further divided into three components
		1. **Material self**  -  things or objects that belong to the person or entities that belongs to the person. 
		2. **Social self** - who the person is in the particular social situation. Change in behavior can be a result form the different social situation. 
		3. **Spiritual self** - self that is more concrete or permanent compared to the material and social selves. It is more subjective and intimate as it deals with the aspects of individual. It always engaging in the process of introspection (self-observation).
- **I self** - Part that knows and recognizes who they are and what they have done.
	- It is called the **Pure Ego**, similar person's soul or mind and the identity.
		- Pure Ego takes account the past, present, and the future selves and individual

### Other Selves in Psychology
#### Global Self
- Represents the **overall value that a person places upon himself** that affects his views and feelings about himself.
-  **The groups of people where a person choose to interacts that strongly influence him**.
-  **His global self is the product of all experiences that he had in the society which account for the kind of person he is.**

##### Murray Bowen
- An American Psychiatrist and a Professor
- He was among those who **developed the Family Therapy and Systematic Therapy**
- He came up with the concept of **differentiated self** based on his observation of the family
- In his theory, there are two forces affecting the person; the first is **togetherness** and the second is **individuality**

###### Differentiated Self
- ability to separate feelings and thoughts, though it still affected by the presence of others. 
- With this knowledge he realizes that for him to attain self-fulfillment, he should separate himself from other group to live and fulfill his destiny.
-  enables the person to develop and sustain his unique personality, make his own choices and accept his responsibility for his behavior without interrupting the emotional connection with his family and friends.

##### Carl Rogers
- American Psychologist
- He is known for his **Person Centered Theory**
	- He stated that the term self-concept is used to refer to how a person thinks  about or perceives himself
- There are two types of self-concept: the **real self-concept** and the **ideal self-concept**

###### Ideal You vs. Real You
- **Real self-concept** refers to all information and perception the person about himself. The first question that can be answered is “Who am I?”
- **Ideal self-concept**  refers to the idealized view carried by experiences, standards, and demands of society. The ideal self is what a person aims for himself to be. The first question that can be answered is “What do I want to be?”

> Rogers stated that there should be **congruence** between the real self and the ideal self in order for the person to be happy and be satisfied in life. If ideal self is different from real self, this would lead to dissatisfaction and failure.

**Self-Discrepancy Theory of Higgins (1987)**
- stated that the people use internalized standards which they compare themselves.  
- **Self-guides** - provides directions for how a person should present himself

- He looked into the significance of play and child development.
- Through play where he observed children/people as having **true** and **false   selves**

###### True and False Selves
- **True self** - self is seen as creative, spontaneously experiencing each day of lives, appreciating being alive, real, integrated and connected to the whole existence.
- **False self** - Manifested as a form of defense. It is the mask that hides the true person for fear of rejection and failure.
>*True and false selves are present in all individuals. For the two exist in a healthy individual, they should be functional for the advantage of both the person himself and the society.*

2. **Forethought** refers to the person’s anticipation of likely outcomes of his behavior
3. **Self-Reactiveness** refers to the process in which the person is motivated and as he   observes his progress in achieving his goals.
4. **Self-Reflectiveness** refers to the person   looking inward and evaluating his motivations,   values, life goals, and other people’s effect on   him. An important aspect of self-reflectiveness   is self-efficacy which is the person’s belief that   he is capable of behavior that will produce the   desired positive results.
