## William James
- American Philosopher
- "Spiritual energy flows in and produces effects, psychological or material, within the phenomenal world"
- One of three components of empirical self proposed by William James
- According to him, the self is all things a person believe to be his or hers and contribute to his or her material self.
- Made up of everything that a person owns
- Refers to tangible objects, people, or places that carry the designation my or mine
- Any material a person own is a contribution to his/her self
- It can also reflect a person of someone’s success or failure or a symbol of one’s social status
- Regardless of how many or little a person owns materially, they will always seek materials to satisfy themselves.
- According to Roland Barthes, it is through objects that people assert their identities. This idea suggests that objects, aside from contributing to how an individual identities himself/herself, also signify relationships of people with others based on what they possess.
- People are likely to purchase products that can relate to their personality. Material possessions signify some aspects of one’s sense of self and identity.
- Possessions tell a lot about their owners. Thus, one’s sense of self and identity is influential on how an individual chooses to purchase his/her wants and how he/she makes economic decisions that will address his/her personal and social needs

### Two subclasses of Material Self
#### Bodily Self
- The parts of the body
- William James stated and identified that the body of an individual is the innermost aspect of the material self. There are certain body parts that you perceive as intimately yours than the rest.

#### Extra Corporeal Self
- Any material possession which extends our body
- The second one is the clothes. We identify ourselves with clothing so it is appropriate to choose clothes that you want to express.
- The third one is family.  Our body, blood, and flesh are the very same in our family. They are part of ourselves.
- The fourth one is home.  This is where we develop our aspects in our life. Those aspects will awaken our feelings of affection in our home.
- The last one are the other possessions such as gadgets, instruments, collections, etc.

### Materials You Possess Reflects You
- **Needs** - Important for survival
- **Wants** - Synonymous with luxuries
#### Utility
- Concerned with how things serve a practical purpose

#### Significance
- Concerned with the meaning assigned to the object. It is also concerned with how objects become powerful symbols or icons of habit and ritual which can be quite separate from their primary function.

#### Materialism
- It is when you give value to material possessions more than intangible values.
- **Materialistic people** are those who are obsessed with having material possessions and this is considered as a *psychological disorder* which is called as *compulsive buying disorder or CBD*.
