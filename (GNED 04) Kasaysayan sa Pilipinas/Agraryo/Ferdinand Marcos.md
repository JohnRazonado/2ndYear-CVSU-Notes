- Orderly and systematic transfer of ownership of tenanted rice and corn lands.
- Flagship of PD 27 and first launched in November 1972 on selected farm in Luzon and Visayas.
- Introduced to the whole country starting in 1973.

### Requirements for farmers to have there own land:
1. Tenant Identification.
2. Parcellary Mapping.
3. Generation, Registration, and Distribution of Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT).
4. Land Valuation and Compensation.
5. Issuance of Emancipation Patents (EP).

> **FB**  - Farmer-beneficiary


A farmer targeted as eligible for inclusion under PD 27 is deemed as farmer-beneficiary (FB). Once issued a Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT), the FB can use this as collateral in borrowing from financial institutions (banks and cooperatives). However, to be issued a Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT), the FB is first require to be a member of Samahang Nayon (SN).

This is to ensure payment to the Land bank who will in turn pay compensation for landlords whose lands were targeted for distribution. Originally, FBs were to pay the LBP the value of the land in 15 equal annual amortizations at 6% per annum interest rate per year. However, there were other modes of payment introduced by the LBP in later years to include the use of bonds and stocks.

Under Section 20 of RA 6657, landowners of agricultural lands subject to acquisition under CARP may enter into a voluntary arrangement for the direct transfer of their lands to qualified beneficiaries. Section 21 of the same Act provides that direct payment may be mad in cash or in kind by the agrarian reform beneficiary (ARB) to the landowner under terms to be mutually agreed upon by both parties, which shall be binding upon registration with and approval by the DAR.



## Samahang Nayon
Marcos declared that land reform means first the conversion of sharecropping from leasehold to ownership. The history of cooperative development prior to 1972 has been marked by failures. While many cooperatives were plagued by technical and financial problems, the most important factor however was lack of enthusiasm on the part of peasants. In 1974, Orlando J. Sacay proposed the creation of the New Cooperative Development Program or the Samahang Nayon, a nationwide cooperative system designed to hasten rural dvelopment. He placed more emphasis on members' education, capital build-up, and discipline.

The SN was intended to prepare farmers to become better producers and ensure timely payments of land amortizations. Capital build-up or capital mobilization, on the other hand are forced or compulsory savings mechanisms that were meant to extend credit from farmers' own savings. The rationale for this was to create a new funding window as traditional rural banks run by well-to-do families became inflexible in servicing the farmers.

The Barrio Savings Fun (BSF) was intended to purchase government equity in rural banks and had the option to purchase shares of stocks and control the rural bank's policies. The SN was able to generate a total of 95M pesos over a five-year period for an average of 100 peso per member and 5,200 pesos per SN.

## Masagana 99

In order to address the severe food shortages, the Masagana 99 Program was started in 1973 as a Program of Survival. Later, rice production was increased as part of the program. A yield of 99 cavans (or 4.4 tons) of unmilled rice per acre was the goal. A financing scheme and the transfer of technology were the two service aspects that Masagana 99 was built around. The program was the first of its kind in its time and an innovative supervised credit program.

The government promised to cover 85% of all losses on Masagana 99 loans, freeing farmers from usury and the onerous conditions banks imposed when giving them loans. Loan applications were handled immediately and quickly. The farm plan and budget for farmers' cooperatives were processed by bank staff and farm technicians. A farmer who is an individual and has collateral to provide may potentially qualify for credit.
