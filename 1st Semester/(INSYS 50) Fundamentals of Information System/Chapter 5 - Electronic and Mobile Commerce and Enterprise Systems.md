## An Introduction to Electronic Commerce
- **Electronic commerce** – Conducting business activities electronically over computer networks such as the Internet, extranets, and corporate networks ^8b8f1c
- Business activities that are strong candidates for conversion to e-commerce: 
	- Paper-based 
	- Time-consuming 
	- Inconvenient for customers

### Business-to-Business (B2B) E-Commerce
- A subset of e-commerce where all the participants are organizations 
- Useful tool for connecting business partners in a virtual supply chain to cut resupply times and reduce costs

### Business-to-Consumer (B2C) E-Commerce
- Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce 
	- Businesses sell their products directly to consumers 
	- Elimination of intermediaries 
		- Squeezes costs and inefficiencies out of supply chain 
		- Can lead to higher profits for companies and lower prices for consumers
>A form of e-commerce in which customers deal directly with an organization and avoid intermediaries.

### Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) E-Commerce
- Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce 
	- Consumers sell directly to other consumers 
	- Example: eBay
>A subset of e-commerce that involves consumers selling directly to other consumers.

### eGovernment
- Use of information and communications technology to: 
	- Simplify the sharing of information 
	- Speed formerly paper-based processes

> The use of information and communications technology to simplify the sharing of information, speed formerly paper-based processes, and improve the relationship between citizen and government.
- Forms of eGovernment 
	- Government-to-consumer (G2C)
		- used to submit their state and federal tax returns online, renew auto licenses, apply for student loans, and make campaign contributions.
	- Government-to-business (G2B) 
		- support the purchase of materials and services from private industry by government procurement offices
	- Government-to-government (G2G)
		- designed to improve communications among the various levels of government. 

## Mobile Commerce
- Relies on the use of wireless devices, such as personal digital assistants, cell phones, and smart phones, to place orders and conduct business

### Mobile Commerce in Perspective
- Market for m-commerce in North America is maturing much later than in Western Europe and Japan 
- Japanese consumers 
	- Generally enthusiastic about new technology 
	- Much more likely to use mobile technologies for making purchases

## Electronic and Mobile Commerce Applications

|Reduces costs| Eliminates time-consuming and labor-intensive steps throughout the order and delivery process so that more sales can be completed in the same period and with increased accuracy.|
|Speeds flow of goods and information| The flow of information is accelerated because of the established electronic connections and communications processes.|
|Increased accuracy| Enables buyers to enter their own product specifications and order information directly so that human data-entry error is eliminated.|
|Improves customer service| Increased and more detailed information about delivery dates and current status increases customer loyalty.|

## Technology Infrastructure Required to Support E-Commerce and M-Commerce
- Successful implementation of e-business requires: 
	- Significant changes to existing business processes 
	- Substantial investment in IS technology 
 - Poor Web site performance 
	 - Drives consumers to abandon some e-commerce sites
![[Pasted image 20230124122357.png]]
> Figure 5.2 - Key Technology Infrastructure Components

### Hardware
- Storage capacity and computing power required of the Web server depends on: 
	- Software that will run on the server 
	- Volume of e-commerce transactions

### Web Server Software

	- The trust that the transaction is being made with the intended party 
	- Encryption 
		- Can provide secure transmission 
	- Digital certificates 
		- Can ensure that transactions are made between the intended parties
		- An attachment to an e-mail message or data embedded in a Web site that verifies the identity of a sender or Web site.

### Electronic Payment Systems
- Certificate authority (CA) 
	- Trusted third-party organization or company that issues digital certificates 
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
	- Used to secure sensitive data 
- Electronic cash 
	- Money that is computerized, stored, and used as cash for e-commerce transactions
- Credit, charge, debit, and smart cards 
	- Used for most of Internet purchases 
- Payments using cell phones 
	- Retail and banking industries are keenly interested in using a cell phone like a credit card

> Table 5.2 - Comparison of Payment Systems

|Payment System| Description| Advantages| Disadvantages|
|---|---|---|---|
|Credit Card | Carries preset spending limit based on the user’s credit history.| Each month the user can pay part or all of the amount owed.| Unpaid balance accumulates interest charges—often at a high rate of interest.|
|Charge card | Looks like a credit card but carries no preset spending limit.| Charge cards do not involve lines of credit and do not accumulate interest charges.| The entire amount charged to the card is due at the end of the billing period.|
|Debit card | Look like a credit cards or automated teller machine (ATM) cards.| Operates like cash or a personal check| Money is immediately deducted from user’s account balance.|
|Smart card | Credit card device with embedded microchip capable of storing facts about card holder| Better protected from misuse than conventional credit, charge, and debit cards because the smart-card information is encrypted| Not widely used in the U.S.|



## An Overview of Enterprise Systems: Transaction Processing Systems and Enterprise Resource Planning

- **Enterprise system**
	- A system central to the organization that ensures information can be shared across all business functions and all levels of management to support the running and managing of a business.
	- Ensures information can be shared across all business functions and all levels of management 
 - Transaction processing systems
	 -  Capture and process the detailed data necessary to update records about the fundamental business operations of the organization
![[Pasted image 20230124124736.png]]
> Figure 5.4 - TPS, MIS/DSS and Special Information Systems in Perspective

### Traditional Transaction Processing Methods and Objectives
- **Batch processing system** ^9bead7
	-  Business transactions are accumulated over a period of time and prepared for processing as a single unit or batch 
 - **Online transaction processing (OLTP)** 
	 - Each transaction is processed immediately, without the delay of accumulating transactions into a batch
![[Pasted image 20230124124958.png]]
> Figure 5.5 - Batch Versus Online Transaction Processing
> (a) Batch processing inputs and processes data in groups.
> (b) In online processing, transactions are completed as they occur. ^58f2ff
