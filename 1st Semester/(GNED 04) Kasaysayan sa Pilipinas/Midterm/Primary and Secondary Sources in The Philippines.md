# Sources in the Philippines

Many of our untapped archival documents here and abroad are written in Spanish. A good knowledge of Spanish is a huge advantage. But this skill is unusual among today’s historians who prefer to read translations of Spanish texts such as the 55-volume.

The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 (1903-1909) edited by Emma Blair and James Robertson, which is the most cited collection of primary sources about the Philippines before the advent of the American colonial regime.

The collection includes translations of portions of 16th century chronicles such as Antonio Pigafetta’s Primo Viaggio intorno al mundo (1524), Miguel Loarca’s Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas (1582), and Juan de Plasencia’s Relacion de las Islas Pilipinas (1592).

Filipino historians, such as the father-daughter tandem of Gregorio Zaide and Sonio Zaide, have also compiled and translated colonial documents. They published the 10- volume Documentary Sources of Philippine History (1994).
