## Objectives
1. Understand the Database System Environment
2. Explain Different DBMS Functions
3. Understand how to manage Database System

## Database
>- Data - Collection of Facts
>- Base - Storage Device
- Shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of:
	- End-user data - Raw facts of interest to end user
	- Metadata: Data about data, which the end-user data are integrated and Managed
		- Describe data Characteristics and relationships
### Metadata
Data about the data. The description and context of the data.
Helps to organize, find and understand data.

#### Typical Metadata
1. Title and description
2. Tags and categories

### Types of Databases
1.  Single-user database - only one unit can use it.
2.  Multiuser database - Multiple user.
3.  Centralized database - data is located at a single site. All in one database
4.  Distributed database - useful for having different branches when having a business
5.  Cloud database - online database, having your database open 24/7
6.  General-purpose database - many disciplines use it
7.  Discipline-specific database - like the use of medical hospital only for one database.
8.  Online analytical processing (OLAP) - big companies use it having a data warehouse
9.  Business intelligence - uses artificial intelligence for decision making.

### Database Management System (DBMS)

### Architecture
1.  Database(data) tier - resides along the getting the data from the environment. Collect all the data needed.
2.  Application (Middle) Tier - using the system to access the database
3.  User (presentation) tier - end-user operates this part where the implementation of the system and database happens without them knowing it.

### DBMS Functions
1.  Data Dictionary management
2.  Data Storage Management
    -   Performance tuning: ensuring efficient performance of read and capacity of storage
3.  Data transformation and presentation
    -   From data to presentation
4.  Security Management
    -   it is a must to be implemented for preventing revealing any information without the owner's consent
5.  Multiuser access control
    -   many user access.
6.  Backup and recovery management
    -   recovery of database
7.  Data integrity management
8.  Database access languages and application programming interfaces

## Basic File Terminology
