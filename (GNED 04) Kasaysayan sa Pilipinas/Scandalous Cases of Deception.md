## WWII Soldiers
- Ferdinand Marcos claimed that he was a decorated World War II soldier who led the guerilla unit called Ang Maharlika
- This was widely believed by students of history and Marcos had war medals to show. 
- This was disproved when historians counterchecked Marcos' claims with the war records of the United States.

## Code Of Kalantiaw
- The code was a set of rules contained in an epic, Maragtas, which was allegedly written by a certain Datu Kalantiaw. 
- It was sold to the National Library and regarded as an important precolonial document until 1968, when American historian William Henry Scott debunked the authenticity of the code due to anachronism and lack of evidence.
