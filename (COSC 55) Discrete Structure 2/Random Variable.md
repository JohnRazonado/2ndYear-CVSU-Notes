## Objectives
- Understand Random variable, Discrete and continuous random variables
- Familiarize on Random phenomena, trial, and event
- Application of Random variable and Probability distribution

# Random Variable
- “A random variable is a numerical description of the outcome of a statistical experiment.” 
- “A Random Variable is a set of possible values from a random experiment.”

Thus, We have an experiment (such as tossing a coin) 
We give **values** to each event
The **set of values** is a **Random Variable**

### Discrete vs Continuous
- A random variable that may assume only a finite number or an infinite sequence of values is said to be **discrete**; 
- One that may assume any value in some interval on the real number line is said to be **continuous**.
- For instance, a random variable representing the number of automobiles sold at a particular dealership on one day would be discrete.
- While a random variable representing the weight of a person in kilograms (or pounds) would be continuous.

**Discrete Data** - can only take certain values (such as 1,2,3,4,5)

**Continuous  Data** - can take any value within a range (such as a person's height).

## Random Variable vs. Algebra Type Variable

- We use a capital letter, like X or Y, to avoid confusion

- Not Like an Algebra Variable ⚫ In Algebra a variable, like x, is an unknown value:

## Sample Space
A Random Variable's set of values is the Sample Space

## Range Of Values
WE COULD ALSO CALCULATE THE PROBABILITY THAT A RANDOM VARIABLE TAKES ON A RANGE OF VALUES.

## The Normal Distribution

- The most important continuous distribution is the **[Standard Normal Distribution](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html)**
- It is so important the Random Variable has its own special letter Z.
- The graph for Z is a symmetrical bell-shaped curve:
- There are many cases where the data tends to be around a central value with no bias left or right, and it gets close to a "Normal Distribution" like this:

> Many things closely follow a Normal Distribution
> - heights of people 
> - size of things produced by machines
> - errors in measurements
> - blood pressure
> - marks on a test


We say the data is "normally distributed":

The **Normal Distribution has: mean = median = mode**
- symmetry about the center
- 50% of values less than the mean and 50% greater than the mean

## Salient Points

- A Random Variable is a set of possible values from a random experiment.
- The set of possible values is called the Sample Space.
- A Random Variable is given a capital letter, such as X or Z.
- Random Variables can be discrete or continuous. 
- An important example of a continuous Random variable is the Standard Normal variable, Z.
