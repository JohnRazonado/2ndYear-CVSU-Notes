##### Memory Types
- **Random Access Memory (RAM)** - Temporary and volatile
- **Read-only Memory (ROM)** - Nonvolatile. Provides permanent storage for data and instructions that do not change.

### Multiprocessing
**Simultaneous** execution of *two or more instructions* at the same time

- Multicore Microprocessor:
	- Combines two or more independent processors into a single computer
- Parallel computing:
	- Simultaneous execution of the same task on multiple processors to obtain results faster
- Grid computing : 
	- *Use of a collection of computers* to work in a *coordinated manner* to solve a common problem

## Secondary Storage and Input and Output Devices
- Secondary storage:
	- Compared with memory, offers the advantages of nonvolatility, greater capacity, and greater economy
	- Considerably slower than memory

### Access Methods
- **Sequential access**:
	- Data must be retrieved in the order in which it is stored 
	- Device used called sequential access storage devices (SASDs)
- **Direct access**:
	- Records can be retrieved in any order
	- Devices used are called direct access storage devices (DASDs)


### Secondary Storage Devices
- **Magnetic tapes** - Primarily for storing backups of critical organizational data
- **Magnetic disks** - Direct-access storage device
- **Redundant array of independent/inexpensive disks (RAID)** - Method of storing that generates extra bits of data from existing data 
- **Virtual tape** - Storage technology for less frequently needed data
- **Storage area network** - Uses computer servers, distributed storage devices, and networks to tie everything together.
- **Optical discs** - Common form of optical disc on which data cannot be modified once it has been recorded
- **Digital video disc (DVD)** - Storage medium used to store software, video games, and movies
- **Solid state secondary storage devices:** - Store data in memory chips rather than magnetic or optical media
	- Have few moving parts, less fragile than hard disk drives
	- Disadvantages
		- High cost per GB 
		- Lower capacity compared to current hard drives.



### Input Devices
Devices used to input general types of data:
- Personal computer input devices
- Speech recognition technology
- Digital cameras
- Touch-sensitive screens
- Optical data readers
- Magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) devices
- Pen input devices
- Magnetic stripe card
- Radio frequency Identification (RFID)

### Output Devices
#### Display monitors
Used to display the output from the com
- Plasma display:
	- Uses thousands of smart cells (pixels) consisting of electrodes and neon and xenon gases that are electrically turned into plasma to emit light
- LCD Display:
	- Flat displays that use liquid crystal
- Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)
	- Use a layer of organic material sandwiched between two conductors
#### Printers and plotters:
