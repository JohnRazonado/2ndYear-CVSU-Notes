## Psychology
- Field of the social sciences that deals with the description, explanation, prediction and control of behavior (Ciccarelli and Meyer, 2006).
- This field believes that the world of material things including people exists independently of the perceiving human mind.
- The study of human behavior connects to the concept of the self. Psychologists provided their own explanations of the self for a better understanding of the individual and their respective behavior.

## William James
![[Pasted image 20230429010218.png]]
- An American Philosopher and Psychologist
- A professor of psychologist   and philosophy at Harvard   University and **known as the greatest pragmatist**
- He is also known for his **Theory of the Self**
- He is the author of the book   titled *“The Principles of Psychology"* where his theory   was explained

### Five Characteristics of Human Thoughts
1. All human thoughts are owned by some personal self.
2. All thoughts are constantly changing or never static.
3. There is a continuity of thoughts as its focus   shifts from one object to another.
4. Thoughts deal with objects that are different   from an independent of consciousness itself.
5. Consciousness can focus on particular objects and not others.

  >As mentioned in the list of thought characteristics above, thoughts are associated with the existence of the self.
  
### The "Me" and "I"
- James believes that the self is composed of two parts: the ME self and the I self.

The ME self can be considered as a separate object or individual that the person refers to when discussing or describing their personal experience.

For example: 
  The gifts were sent to me.

  The person is smiling at me.
  
The Me self appears to the empirical ME. The ME self is further divided into three components namely: the material self, the social self, and the spiritual self.

1. The Material self consist of the things or objects that belong to the person or entities that belongs to the person. Remember, that the body is the core material of the self and everything that is attached to it is associated and identifies the person.
2. The Social self refers to who the person is in the particular social situation. Change in behavior can be a result form the different social situation. The person chooses the self that would smoothly adapt or allow him to fit in social situation.
3. The Spiritual self refers to the self that is more concrete or permanent compared to the material and social selves. It is more subjective and intimate as it deals with the aspects of individual personality, values, and morals that are usually constant. The spiritual self is always engaging in the process of introspection (self-observation).

James believes that the self is composed of two parts: the ME self and the I self.

The I self is the part that knows and recognizes who they are and what they have done.

For example: 

  I borrowed the book from the library.
  I won the game.

The I self is called the Pure Ego. It is similar to person’s soul or mind and the identity. The Pure ego takes into account the past, present, and the future selves and individual. This perception of identity arises from a continuous stream of human consciousness.

## Other Selves in Psychology
### Global Self
  It represents the **overall value that a person places upon himself** that affects his views and feelings about himself. It is inevitable for a person to be born and to grow up in the presence of other people. **The groups of people where  a person choose to interacts that strongly influence him**. He turns to them for support and seeks for his approval in the journey of finding himself.  **His global self is the product of all experiences that he had in the society which account for the kind of  person he is.**

### Murray Bowen
![[Pasted image 20230429010250.png]]
- An American Psychiatrist and   a Professor
- He was among those who **developed the Family Therapy and Systematic Therapy**
- He came up with the concept   of **differentiated self** based on   his observation of the family
- In his theory, he observed that   there are two forces affecting   the person; the first is   togetherness and the second   is individuality

### Differentiated Self
It has the ability to separate feelings and thoughts, though it still affected by the presence of others. The person recognizes that the he has his own personality and therefore endowed with unique characteristics not dependent to the opinion of other people. With this knowledge he realizes that for him to attain self-fulfillment, he should separate himself from other group to live and fulfill his destiny.

The differentiated self enables the person to develop and sustain his unique personality, make his own choices and accept his responsibility for his behavior without interrupting the emotional connection with his family and friends.

### Carl Rogers
![[Pasted image 20230429010318.png]]
- An American Psychologist
- He is known for his  Person Centered Theory
- He stated that the term self-  concept is used to refer to   how a person thinks  about or   perceives himself
- There are two types of self-concept: the **real self-concept**   and the **ideal self-concept**

### Ideal You vs. Real You
The **real self-concept** refers to all information and perception the person about himself. The first question that can be answered is “Who am I?”

The **ideal self-concept** refers to the idealized view carried by experiences, standards, and demands of society. The ideal self is what a person aims for himself to be. The first question that can be answered is “What do I want to be?”

#### Most important in the two self-concept
Rogers stated that there should be congruence between the real self and the ideal self in order for the person to be happy and be satisfied in life.

If the ideal self is different from the real self this would a lead a person to experience dissatisfaction and may see himself as a failure (Feist & Feist, 2008).

According to Self-Discrepancy theory of  Higgins (1987) stated that the people use internalized standards which they compare themselves.  These are called self-guides which provides directions for how a person should present himself. Self-discrepancy arises when the self is found to be deviating from these guides and may  lead to emotional discomfort.

#### Multiple and Unified Selves
The Multiple Selves Theory suggest that there exists in the individual different aspects of the self. It makes sense that the self is a whole made up of parts. These parts of the self may manifest themselves when situations calls for it. The psychologically healthy individual can make sense of the sometimes confusing and conflicting aspects of themselves to be integrated into a single or unified self.

A unified being is essentially connected to consciousness, awareness and agency. To be considered as well adjusted person, should be able to deal with and accept complexities and the perceived unfairness that exist in life. They can manifest content with present state of affairs and continue to adjust, adapt, evolve and survive as an individual with an integrated, unified multiple selves.

### D. W. Winnicot
![[Pasted image 20230429010848.png]]
- An English pediatrician and psychoanalyst
- He looked into the significance   of play and child development.
- It is also through play where   he observed children/people   as having **true** and **false   selves**

### True and False Selves
The **true self** in individuals is one in which self is seen as creative, spontaneously experiencing each day of lives, appreciating being alive, real, integrated and connected to the whole existence. It is further characterized by a high level of awareness in the person of who he is, what he is capable of and does not afraid to let other knows know his weakness and imperfections.

The **false self** may be manifested as a form of defense. It is the mask that hides the true person for fear of rejection and failure. It arises when the person is forced to comply with existing social norms and standards. At times false selves enable the person to form superficial but productive social relationships.

*True and false selves are present in all individuals. For the two exist in a healthy individual, they should be functional for the advantage of both the person himself and the society.*

### Albert Bandura
![[Pasted image 20230429010900.png]]
- An American psychologist
- He is the proponent of The **Social Cognitive Theory**
- He also believes that core of learning is through **observation**
- He believes that the *human agency* is the essence of   being a human
- The human undergoes with **Triardic Reciprocal Causation   Paradigm**

### Features of Human Agency
In the Social Cognitive Theory, Bandura discusses the four features of human agency:

1. Intentionality refers to the actions   performed by the person intentionally or with   full awareness of his behavior. This feature   involves planning with awareness of the   possible consequences of actions.
2. Forethought refers to the person’s   anticipation of likely outcomes of his behavior
3. **Self-Reactiveness** refers to the process in   which the person is motivated and as he   observes his progress in achieving his goals.
4. **Self- Reflectiveness** refers to the person   looking inward and evaluating his motivations,   values, life goals, and other people’s effect on   him. An important aspect of self-reflectiveness   is self-efficacy which is the person’s belief that   he is capable of behavior that will produce the   desired positive results.

#### Self Regulation
It allows the person to set goals that are better and higher than the former, challenging his capabilities to become wiser and self-actualized individual (Feist & Feist, 2008).
