The creation of the system utilizes C# as their programming language of choice and Visual Studio being their IDE.

This somewhat different to other conceptual framework but that differences are very little indeed

#### Output

-   Inventory Triggering System with Parcel Status Information for BC-MAN Enterprises

#### Evaluation

#### Methodology

The inventory system with notification for BC-Man Enterprises was developed using different diagrams and methodologies to specify and clarify the project. This uses a Feature Driven Development methodology in developing the software. It also uses Google Chrome apparently to run the system which needed to support Visual Studio 2012, WAMP Server, MySQL, and any operating system.

##### Research design

it uses FDD or **Feature Driven Development** approach by Puri, 2010. Having an overall model of: developing overall model; build feature list; plan by feature; design by feature; and build by feature.

#### Sources of Data and Tool

This also uses interview to gather information from the clients.

This research uses Stratified Random Sampling targeting one 1 admin, 2 sales coordinator, and 33 client of BC-Man enterprise.
