 %%Need to add more information and reorganize%%

## Principles
- Value of information is directly proportional to how it helps decision makers
	- distinguish data from information
- Know the potential impact of information systems
	- Identify basic types of business information systems
- System users, business managers, and information systems professionals must work together to build a successful information system
- Use of information system to add value to the organizations
- Cooperation between business managers and IS personnel is the key to unlocking the potential of any new or modified system

## Information Concepts
- **Data** - Raw Facts
- **Information** - Collection of facts organized to have values beyond the facts themselves
- **Process** – Set of *logically related tasks* performed to achieve a define outcome
- **Knowledge** - Awareness and understanding of a set of information

### Different Types of Data
|Data| Represented by|
|---|---|
|Alphanumeric data| Numbers, letters, and other characters|
|Image data| Graphic images and pictures|
|Audio data| Sound, noise, or tones|
|Video data| Moving images or pictures

### Transforming Data to Information
![](Pasted%20image%2020221027153447.png)

### Characteristics of Valuable information
- If Information not accurate or complete
	- People can make poor decisions
	- Disaster and failures (costing thousands or millions of dollars)
- Information can have little value 
	- if information isn't relevant
	- Not delivered in a timely fashion (to decision makers)
	- Too complex to understand
### Value of Information
- Can help people (and their organizations) perform tasks more efficiently and effectively.
- Help managers in deciding whether to invest additional information systems and technology.



## Information System
- **Feedback Mechanism**
	- Component that helps organizations achieve their goals
		- Increasing profits or improving customer service
	- It is critical in any operation system
![](Pasted%20image%2020221027155213.png)

### Components
1. **Input** - Gather and capture raw data
2. **Processing** - Converting or transforms data into useful outputs
3. **Output** - Production of useful info, usually in documents and reports form.
4. **Feedback** - Output that make changes to input or processing.

### Information Systems can be:
- **Manual**
	- Ex: Developing pattern and trends on **graph paper or stock analysis**.
- **Computerized**
	- Ex: **Use of program** trading to track market and trade large block of stocks when discrepancies occur.

## Computer-Based Information Systems
- Single set of hardware, software, databases, telecommunications, people, and procedures configure to: data into information
	- collect
	- manipulate
	- store
	- and process
- Information technology (IT)
	- Hardware, software, databases, and telecommunications
![](Pasted%20image%2020221027162809.png)

### CBIS components
1. **Hardware** - Computer equipment used to perform input, processing, and output activities
2. **Software** - Computer programs that *govern* the operation of computer
3. **Database** - Organized collection of facts and information
4. **Telecommunications** - Electronic transmission of signals for communications
5. **Networks** - Connect computers and equipment in a building, around the country, and around the world
6. **Internet** - World's largest computer network
7.  **People** - Manage, run, program, and maintain system
8. **Procedures** - Strategies, policies, methods and rules using CBIS

## Business Information Systems
Most common types of information systems used are those designed for:
- [[Electronic and mobile commerce]]
- [[Transaction processing]]
- [[Management information]]
- [[Decision support]]

### Specialized Business Information System

#### Knowledge Management Systems (KMSs)
- Organized collection of people, procedures, software, databases, and devices

#### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Field in which computer takes the characteristics of human intelligence
- Robotics, vision systems, and natural language processing
![[Pasted image 20221110085648.png]]

#### Expert Systems
- Give the computer the ability to make suggestions and act like an expert in a particular field

#### Virtual Reality
- The simulation of a real or imagined environment that can be experience visually in three dimensions

## Systems Development
- Creating or modifying existing business systems
- Systems development failures can be a result of:
	- Poor planning and scheduling 
	- Insufficient management of risk
	- Poor requirements determination
	- Lack of user involvement
- **Outsourcing**
	- Allows a company to focus on what it does best and delegate other functions.

#### Systems Investigation
- Goal is to gain understanding of the problem to be solved or opportunity to be addressed
#### System analysis
- Defines problems and opportunities of the existing system.
#### Systems design
- Determines how the new system will work to meet the business needs defined during systems analysis
#### Systems implementation
- Creating or acquiring the system components defined in the design step, assembling them, and putting the new system into operation.
#### Systems maintenance and review
- Checking and modifying the system so that it continues to meet changing business needs.

## [[Organization]]
- Collection of people and other resources established to accomplish a set of goals
-  Has inputs, processing mechanisms, outputs, and feedback

## Competitive Advantage
- Significant, long-term benefit to a company over its competition
- An organization often uses its information system to help achieve a competitive advantage.

### Five-forces model identifies key factors
- Rivalry among existing competitors
- Threat of new entrants
- Threat of substitute products and services
- Bargaining power of buyers
- Bargaining power of suppliers

### Strategic Planning for Competitive Advantage
- **Cost leadership**
	- Deliver the lowest possible products and services
	- Means being the leader of the pack having the lowest price as possible in the market
- **Differentiation**
	- Deliver different products and services
- **Niche strategy**
	- Deliver to a small, niche market
- **Altering the industry structure**
	- Change the industry to become more favorable to organization.
	- Strategic alliance or strategic partnership can be also an answer to this one.
- **Creating new products and services**
	- Introduce periodically or frequently
- **Improve existing product lines and service**
	- Make real or perceived improvements
- **Other Strat**
	- Growth in sales
	- First to market
	- Customizing products and services
	- Hiring the best people

## Performance-Based Information Systems
### 3 Major Stages
- Organizations focused using Information Systems to reduce costs and improve productivity.
- Companies generally ignored revenue potential, not looking for opportunities to use information systems to increase sales.
- Companies carefully consider both strategic advantage and costs

![[Pasted image 20221110105545.png]]

### Productivity
- Output achieved divided by input required
- Higher level of output given level of input means greater productivity
- Lower level of output for a given level of input means lower productivity.

### Return on Investment and the Value of Information Systems
- Earnings growth
	- Increase in profits
- Market share
	- Percentage of sales in relation to total market 
- Customer awareness and satisfaction
	- Based on feedback from internal and external users
- Total cost of ownership 
	- Sum of all costs over the life of the information system

### Risk
- Managers must consider the risks of: 
	- Designing, developing, and implementing new or modified information systems 
- Information systems can be costly failures
- Costs of development and implementation can be greater than the returns from the new system
