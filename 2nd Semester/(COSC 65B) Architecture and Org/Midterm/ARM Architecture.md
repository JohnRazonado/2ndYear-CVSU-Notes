- Family of RISC design used in embedded systems
- Designed by **ARM Holdings**, Cambridge, England.
	- Company doesn’t make processors but instead designs microprocessor and multicore architectures and licenses them to manufacturers.
- Two types of licensable products:
	- **Processors:** buy rights to use ARM designed processors
	- **Processor architectures:** buy rights to design own processor compliant with ARM's architecture.
- High-speed processors known for small die size and low power requirements. 
- Widely used in smartphones and other handheld devices, including game systems.
	- Use by Apple’s popular iPod and iPhone devices, and are used in virtually all Android smartphones as well.
- Probably the most widely used embedded processor architecture and indeed the most widely used processor architecture of any kind in the world.

They have number of specialized microprocessors mostly is the Cortex family of microprocessors architectures.
- There are **three Cortex architectures**, conveniently labelled with the initials **A**, **R**, and **M**.
	- **CORTEX-A/CORTEX-A50**
		- **Application processors**
		- Intended for mobile devices such as smartphones and eBook readers, as well as consumer devices like digital TV and home gateways (e.g., DSL and cable Internet modems).
	-  **CORTEX-R** 
		- Support **real-time applications**, in which the timing of events needs to be controlled with rapid response to events.
		- Examples of embedded systems that would use the Cortex-R are automotive braking systems, mass storage controllers, and networking and printing devices.
	- **CORTEX-M**
		- Primarily for **microcontroller domain** that needs fast and lowest possible power consumption.
		- Market includes IoT devices, wireless sensor/actuator networks used in factories and other enterprises, automotive body electronics, and so on.
